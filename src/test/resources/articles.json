[{"id":1121452019,"title":"Hard Questions on Nuclear Power","body":"After decades in the doghouse because of environmental, safety and cost concerns, nuclear power is enjoying a renaissance of expectations. The Bush administration\u0027s new energy plan gives a place of prominence to nuclear power as a clean and efficient energy source, and the industry itself is bubbling with new hopes and plans. In truth, there are good reasons to take a fresh look at this much-maligned source of energy that has been stalled in this country for the past three decades. But it is worrisome that the administration seems to have endorsed a nuclear resurgence with little sustained analysis of its pluses and minuses. As an article by Katharine Seelye in The Times revealed last week, nuclear energy was barely in the consciousness of the drill-centric energy team at the White House until a delegation of nuclear industry executives sought a chance to make their pitch and succeeded so well that Vice President Dick Cheney almost immediately started touting the virtues of nuclear energy. A case can be made for greater exploitation of nuclear power in this country, but before the nation plunges too far down this path the administration will need to address some critical questions. The rationale for a reassessment comes partly from the performance of the industry itself, and partly from changed circumstances in the environment in which it must operate. By most accounts, the industry has learned to operate its plants more safely and efficiently than in the years leading up to the traumatic near-tragedy at Three Mile Island. American nuclear plants are operating with much greater reliability and many fewer minor incidents. Moreover, the industry is consolidating, with plants being purchased and operated by companies that have more expertise than some of the previous operators. So there is reason to trust the industry a bit more than in past decades. Meanwhile, external events are increasing the appeal of nuclear power. One is the rising concern over global warming, which is caused primarily by the emission of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Nuclear power plants emit no carbon dioxide, thus to the extent they can replace plants burning coal, oil or natural gas they can be considered a plus. Nuclear power can also contribute to the diversity of the nation\u0027s energy supplies. Nuclear plants already supply some 20 percent of the electricity generated in this country, compared with fossil fuel contributions of 52 percent for coal, 16 percent for natural gas and 3 percent for oil. But the great majority of all new power plants are being built to burn natural gas, the cleanest of the fossil fuels, making utilities and consumers vulnerable to price spikes when supplies become tight as they have this year. President Bush\u0027s energy plan offers a wide range of steps to accelerate the use of nuclear power. But before Congress and the regulatory agencies proceed too far, some crucial questions require answers. Impact on global warming: If this is the main reason for turning to nuclear power, the proponents will need to do a much better job of spelling out just how far nuclear power would have to spread to make a real dent in the problem. Nuclear power is used almost exclusively to generate electricity, thus it cannot reduce the nation\u0027s reliance on imported oil to power transportation systems. Nuclear fuel will primarily be substituting for natural gas -- the least of the carbon dioxide emitters -- as the clean fuel to which electric utilities turn. Moreover, fossil fuels are burned in mining and preparing nuclear fuels and in building reactors, so even nuclear energy is not entirely free of greenhouse gases. Some analyses suggest that to make a real impact in slowing global warming, nuclear power plants would need to spread widely around the world, a prospect that brings new challenges of its own. Weapons risks: Expansion of nuclear power in this country poses no weapons danger, but the spread of nuclear plants into other countries could pose a risk. The uranium fuel for nuclear power plants is not generally considered of high enough grade to be used in weapons. But as more and more technicians around the world learn the skills of working with nuclear materials, and as governments become engaged in procuring nuclear technologies, there is a danger that civilian nuclear programs could serve as a cover for clandestine weapons activities. That is why, for example, the United States is angry that Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear power plant. Even though Iran has pledged to abide by nonproliferation treaties and allow international inspections of the plant, there is grave concern that it will find a way to build weapons. Increasing the use of nuclear power in countries that already have either the bomb or nuclear power plants is not much of a danger. Spreading nuclear power to additional countries might be. Waste disposal: In the political world, the lack of a proven method to store spent fuel from nuclear reactors for the tens of thousands of years the material remains radioactive has long been considered the Achilles\u0027 heel of the nuclear industry. In truth, spent fuel has been stored safely for decades in pools at the sites of nuclear power plants with no adverse effect. The problem is, the storage pools are filling up and critics are loath to expand nuclear power with no clear idea where to store the waste. The Bush administration is considering a site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada that has been studied for years, and it has proposed a new look at reprocessing the fuel to remove the long-lived plutonium for reuse as reactor fuel. That could greatly ease the storage problem here but might encourage wider use of reprocessed materials abroad, increasing the risk of weapons-grade plutonium\u0027s falling into the wrong hands. Reactor safety: The safety problem in conventional nuclear plants is that, if things start to go wrong, emergency cooling systems and human operators have to act correctly to prevent a catastrophic meltdown. That makes nuclear power a cruel and unforgiving technology that cannot tolerate equipment failures or human mistakes. But the industry is exploring new technologies that would not lead to meltdown even in a worst-case malfunction, making them inherently safer and cheaper to build and operate. This is where the administration and the industry should be focusing their efforts -- to develop demonstrably safer power plants. That would ease many of the concerns provoked by the current generation of nuclear reactors. Economics: No matter what else is done to make nuclear power more attractive, the industry will make little headway unless it can overcome the high capital costs that brought it to a halt in recent decades. Some relief should come from the advance approval of standardized designs, allowing plants to be built more quickly and cheaply than in past years when each plant had a customized design. But Congress will need to take a close look at whether it should renew one of the industry\u0027s economic underpinnings -- the so-called Price-Anderson Act that limits the liability of nuclear companies in the event of an accident. If the industry is as safe as it says, it may not need such subsidized protection. On the other hand, eliminating the liability protection might scare off investors for good. Nuclear power has been stalled for so long in the United States that it is surprising to see it back in the spotlight. There may be a case for extending the licenses of existing plants, as has already happened in several cases, or for building new plants on existing nuclear sites where the risks are already understood. But the case has not yet been made for truly large-scale expansion of nuclear power, in this country or around the globe.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9F0DE6D7153CF93AA15756C0A9679C8B63","date":"May 29, 2001 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-249386823,"title":"As Demand for Electricity Increases, China Sticks With Nuclear Power","body":"BEIJING Meltdowns of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan last March have put a chill on much of the world’s nuclear power industry — but not in China. The German Parliament voted this summer to close the country’s remaining nuclear power plants by 2022, while the Swiss Parliament voted this summer to phase nuclear power out by 2034. Economic stagnation in the United States and most other industrialized economies since 2008 has produced stagnant electricity demand, further sapping interest in nuclear power. In Japan itself, the government has put on hold its plans to build further nuclear power plants, and the government faces a political battle to continue operating existing reactors. Emerging economies like Brazil and particularly India are still planning nuclear reactors. But the Indian leaders introduced legislation on Sept. 7 that is supposed to increase the independence of nuclear regulators from the industry, though critics are skeptical. That leaves China poised to build more nuclear reactors in the coming years than the rest of the world combined. But questions abound whether China will be a savior for the international nuclear power industry, or a ferocious competitor that could create even greater challenges for nuclear power companies in the West. Chinese regulators performed a four-month review of safety at all existing nuclear reactors and reactors under construction after the Fukushima meltdowns and declared them safe. Safety reviews continue at reactors where construction had not yet started at the time of the Fukushima accident. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, said that the government was sticking to its target of 50 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2015, compared to just 10.8 gigawatts at the end of last year. Mr. Jiang said in an interview that nuclear power construction targets for 2020 had not yet been set and might end up slightly lower than they would have been without the meltdowns in Fukushima. But he and other Chinese officials say that China’s rapidly rising electricity consumption makes nuclear power essential. They even try to portray the Fukushima incidents as salutary for the nuclear power industry, a view seldom heard elsewhere. “Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power,” Mr. Jiang said. “We can learn a lot from that. We can’t be smug or too clever.” China allowed existing reactors to continue operating during the safety review from March to July and allowed construction to continue at reactors where it had already begun. Chinese regulators have also encouraged electric utilities to continue planning future nuclear power plants. But one category of reactor has been delayed by the Fukushima incident. At reactors that had been approved before the Fukushima accident but where construction had not yet begun, the government still has not allowed construction to start while continuing to study whether further safety improvements can be made, said Xu Yuanhui, one of China’s top nuclear engineers for the past half century. The delay applies to several conventional nuclear reactors plus Beijing’s project to build two reactors in northeastern China, using a new generation of technology known as a pebble-bed design. Critics and advocates describe it as safer than current reactors, though its cost-effectiveness unclear. The two reactors in Shidao, in Shandong Province in northeast China, were approved days before the Fukushima nuclear accident began with an earthquake and tsunami March 11. But the 50-month timetable for building them cannot start until the government lifts its hold on construction. “By the end of this year, maybe we’ll have some information from the government side,” Dr. Xu said. Nuclear power represented only 1.1 percent of China’s electricity generation capacity at the end of last year. With wind turbines and coal-fired power plants being installed at rates that far surpass those in any other country, nuclear power is on track to account for no more than 4 percent of electricity capacity by 2015. A big part of the appeal of nuclear energy for Chinese officials is that it supplies baseload power, meaning it is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week to meet needs. China passed the United States last year as the world’s largest installer of wind turbines, but wind still accounts for only 3.2 percent of China’s installed electricity generation capacity and less than 2 percent of electricity generated. Coal remains by far the dominant source of electricity in China, producing three-quarters of the country’s electricity. Nuclear power mainly displaces coal as a source of baseload power. That has also made it popular with Chinese officials, as they have set increasingly ambitious targets to slow the country’s rapid rise in emissions of global warming gases, in which the country already leads the world. Until reliable, large-scale storage of electricity is perfected for renewable energy sources like the wind and sun, “they’ve got to continue using nuclear as a fundamental part of their fuel mix,” said James A. Maguire, the regional managing director for Asian infrastructure at Aon Risk Solutions, a risk management and insurance broker. Coal is the most polluting major source of electricity in terms of emissions of climate-changing gases, while nuclear power is one of the cleanest. Coal mining accidents also kill more than 2,000 people a year in China, and large areas of the countryside in northern China have been heavily polluted. China is paying particular attention to nuclear safety issues, however, because it has some of the world’s most densely populated rural areas. If a nuclear accident rendered even a small area around a power plant uninhabitable, many would need to be resettled. China now has an unusually varied fleet of nuclear reactors, using French, American, Russian and homegrown technology. While awarding contracts to a wide range of multinational nuclear power plant contractors, it has required that they provide documentation on exactly how to build the reactors. That will give China the ability to export reactors in a few years, in competition with industrialized nations, nuclear power industry experts warned. Demand outside China could revive if memories of the Fukushima accident fade or if worries about global warming become more pressing. China is not only acquiring technology. It is also creating economies of scale by building dozens of reactors at the same time. As a population equal to New York City’s moves into China’s cities each year demanding air-conditioners and other electricity-guzzling conveniences, consumption is likely to continue growing by double digits. “It’s the largest migration in history, so they need to build a lot of infrastructure,” said Dennis Bracy, the chief executive of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, a bilateral discussion group formed by the Chinese government with prominent Americans from previous Republican and Democratic administrations. “I believe they will stay with nuclear as part of the portfolio.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/china-marches-on-with-nuclear-energy-in-spite-of-fukushima.html","date":"Oct 11, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-715642011,"title":"Nuclear Power Gains in Status After Lobbying","body":"As the White House was putting together the energy plan that President Bush released last week, there had been almost no talk of nuclear power as a component of the nation\u0027s energy strategy. The nuclear industry thought this was a glaring omission, and a handful of top nuclear industry officials decided they needed to take their case to the administration. In mid-March, a cadre of seven nuclear power executives sought and won an hourlong meeting in the White House with Karl Rove, Mr. Bush\u0027s top political adviser. Also attending were Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president\u0027s top economic adviser, Andrew Lundquist, the executive director of Vice President Dick Cheney\u0027s energy task force, and others involved in devising the energy plan. \u0027\u0027We said, Look, we are an important player on this energy team and here are our vital statistics, and we think that you should start talking about nuclear when you talk about increasing the nation\u0027s supply,\u0027\u0027 Christian H. Poindexter, chairman of the Constellation Energy Group, recalled today. And then a surprising thing happened. \u0027\u0027It was shortly after that, as a matter of fact I think the next night, when the vice president was being interviewed on television, he began to talk about nuclear power for the first time,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Poindexter said. Mr. Cheney first discussed nuclear power as an alternative to dirtier fossil fuels in a March 21 interview on CNBC. \u0027\u0027If you want to do something about carbon dioxide emissions,\u0027\u0027 he said, \u0027\u0027then you ought to build nuclear power plants because they don\u0027t emit any carbon dioxide, they don\u0027t emit greenhouse gases.\u0027\u0027 Mr. Cheney had missed the meeting with nuclear executives because he was on Capitol Hill, talking to members of Congress who themselves were pushing nuclear energy. In a quick chain reaction, Mr. Cheney put the long-maligned nuclear power industry back on the political map. In the energy plan released last week, the administration breathed new life into the industry, declaring nuclear technology, which provides 20 percent of the nation\u0027s electricity, much safer than it was 20 years ago. Today, Mr. Cheney appeared before 350 nuclear industry executives meeting in Washington -- 100 more than showed up at last year\u0027s annual meeting of the Nuclear Energy Institute -- and told them the administration wanted to encourage the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to expedite applications for new reactors, relicense existing plants and \u0027\u0027increase the resources devoted to safety and enforcement as we prepare to increase nuclear generating capacity in the future.\u0027\u0027 He said the administration also wanted to renew the Price-Anderson Act, which limits nuclear plant operators\u0027 liability in case of an accident. Mr. Poindexter is still incredulous. \u0027\u0027In my wildest dreams, when I was over at the White House in March, I couldn\u0027t imagine them getting so behind us,\u0027\u0027 he said. He was skeptical for good reason. Few industries have enjoyed the kind of renaissance that nuclear power may be poised to undergo. Accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in Ukraine seemed to seal the industry\u0027s fate as too dangerous, too uncontrollable and too expensive to win back a frightened public or secure the financial backing of Wall Street. The last nuclear power plant to enter operation was ordered in 1973. There still is no solution to the vexing problem of nuclear waste storage. And while recent polling shows that Americans more lopsidedly oppose dirtier fossil fuels than they oppose nuclear power, they still do not want to live near nuclear power plants. For those wary of a nuclear revival, these problems are no less real today than they were two decades ago. \u0027\u0027The Bush administration should at most be looking to proceed with what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was planning -- an orderly phase-out of existing power plants,\u0027\u0027 said Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute and co-director of the Senate investigation into the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. \u0027\u0027Instead, they\u0027re talking about a new rebirth, and it frankly just doesn\u0027t make sense.\u0027\u0027 The Union of Concerned Scientists, using data from the industry itself, says that aging plants have experienced eight forced shutdowns in the last 16 months. And Mr. Leventhal said that replacing coal with nuclear power would not appreciably diminish global warming because most of the pollutants that cause global warming come from cars and trucks. Another problem, and one that Mr. Cheney fully acknowledges, is the lack of a national repository for the storage of nuclear waste. In his speech today, the vice president warned that the lack of a storage site could be a deal killer. Without a site, he said, \u0027\u0027eventually the contribution we can count on from the nuclear industry will, in fact, decline.\u0027\u0027 The storage problem will not be solved at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, if Nevada politicians and the gambling industry have anything to say about it. Senators Harry Reid, a Democrat, and John Ensign, a Republican, have made opposition to nuclear waste dumping in their state their priority. \u0027\u0027Until they get the waste problem solved,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Reid said, \u0027\u0027nothing\u0027s going to happen on nuclear power.\u0027\u0027 Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who now teaches energy policy at Yale, said that apart from the safety issues, nuclear power was economically problematic. \u0027\u0027The types of long-term investment necessary to sustain nuclear energy are going to prove very hard to find in this kind of volatile marketplace,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Bradford said. Still, there are cheerleaders. One is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee. He spoke today at the Nuclear Energy Institute\u0027s annual meeting and summed up the surprise that others feel at the recent turn of events. \u0027\u0027As we gather here in Washington,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Tauzin said, \u0027\u0027who would have thunk that we\u0027d be discussing the possibility of nuclear construction in this country?\u0027\u0027","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9F0DEEDE133DF930A15756C0A9679C8B63","date":"May 23, 2001 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1579728494,"title":"The Nuclear Power Option","body":"In his sketchy speech on energy policy last week, President Bush placed a high priority on nuclear energy, which he described as \u0027\u0027one of the safest, cleanest sources of power in the world.\u0027\u0027 The president had good reason to suggest an important role for this much-feared energy source. The price of natural gas, the current fuel of choice for power plants, has risen sharply. And there is mounting evidence that damage from global warming may dwarf any environmental risk posed by nuclear power. It is therefore critical to keep nuclear power as part of the nation\u0027s energy mix. But Mr. Bush will have to address some crucial concerns before the public will follow him down the nuclear path with much enthusiasm. For starters, there is the awkward fact that nuclear power plants pose a risk of proliferating the materials and skills to make nuclear weapons. That is not an issue in the United States, which already has a mammoth nuclear arsenal. But if the United States resurrects its stagnant nuclear industry, other nations may also turn to nuclear power, with the risk that rogue nations may someday use the fuel to make bombs. The Bush administration will need to find ways, perhaps through the nuclear nonproliferation review that started yesterday, to ensure that power plants do not become an easy route to nuclear weapons. Beyond that, Mr. Bush will need to ensure that the pools holding spent fuel at domestic nuclear plants can be made safe from terrorists. He will have to devise a backup plan for storing nuclear waste, should the proposed burial site at Yucca Mountain prove untenable after legal and regulatory setbacks. He will need to invest in new, potentially safer reactor designs to allay longstanding concerns about accidents. Finally, one familiar impediment to nuclear power -- the high capital costs required up front -- could remain troublesome, unless the cost of competing fuels soars higher. None of these concerns need rule out this promising source of power. But they will need to be addressed forthrightly.

That should not be surprising. Since they derive from human knowledge, their effective application must be learned, and they compete for social and economic territory. Nuclear power, a product of naval propulsion research, emerged in the United States in the 1950\u0027s. Its first use as a commercial energy source came about because it had obvious benefits for pollution control. A Pennsylvania utility, Duquesne Light, built the first commercial nuclear power reactor at Shippingport, Pa., in 1954. The utility had planned to build a coal-fired power plant. When the public objected to further smoke pollution around smoky Pittsburgh, Duquesne switched to nuclear power. Public acceptance of a new technology is essential to its growth. Nuclear power, associated in the public\u0027s mind with nuclear weapons, was probably commercialized prematurely, while its complexities were still being worked out. Its environmental benefits were not fully appreciated in the early decades because air pollution was abating under government regulation in the 1960\u0027s and 1970\u0027s, and global warming had not yet emerged as the ultimate environmental challenge. When conservation slowed electricity demand after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and 1974, utilities canceled orders for new power plants, both nuclear and coal. Almost all new plants built since then have been fueled with natural gas. But the population of the United States is growing, adding the equivalent of one California every 10 years. Demand has caught up with supply even with significant improvements in energy efficiency and conservation, and the United States has become the world\u0027s leading greenhouse gas emitter. These factors make a renewal of nuclear power likely. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has begun carefully extending licenses for existing reactors for an additional 20 years; eventually all 104 operating United States power reactors will probably be relicensed. Since they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases, that\u0027s good news. The nuclear industry is consolidating, focusing experience and expertise. Several reactors that have been shut down will probably be restored to operation. Several others that were left unfinished when demand slowed will probably be completed. Two or three new advanced light-water reactors, designs the N.R.C. has already pre-licensed, will probably be built at sites that already have construction permits. One company, Exelon, is considering seeking licensing of a simpler reactor, designed so that it cannot melt down, that uses a bed of billiard-ball-sized \u0027\u0027pebbles\u0027\u0027 of compacted uranium oxide and graphite as its fuel and helium as its coolant and working fluid, passing the fission-heated helium directly into a turbine to generate electricity even more cheaply than burning natural gas. If the pebble-bed modular reactor wins approval from the N.R.C., other utilities may decide to use this technology as well. Americans are beginning to understand one of the unique benefits of nuclear technology. A majority now say they approve of nuclear power, a shift that appears to indicate awareness that nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. There is less evidence of public understanding of radiation and nuclear waste. Antinuclear activism began in the 1960\u0027s with concerns about the disposal of nuclear waste, and disposal continues to be the nuclear industry\u0027s Number 1 public-relations problem. The disposal debate is likely to move to center stage later this year, when the scientists and engineers evaluating Yucca Mountain, north of Las Vegas, as a possible permanent waste repository expect to deliver their final report. All energy technologies produce waste. Burning fossil fuels -- even relatively clean fuel like natural gas -- generates waste that cannot be contained within the power plant, as nuclear waste is, but must be released into the environment as air pollution and toxic waste. In the case of coal, burning releases ash that is mildly radioactive, because radioactive uranium and thorium are ubiquitous in the earth\u0027s crust, including coal seams. Even renewable technologies like wind power and solar photovoltaics produce waste: manufacturing the materials for the multitude of collectors necessary to gather up such diffuse sources as wind and sunlight requires burning fossil fuels. Thus wind or solar power systems release far more greenhouse gases across their life cycles than does a nuclear system of equivalent output. The great advantage of nuclear power is its ability to wrest enormous energy from a small volume of fuel. One metric ton of nuclear fuel produces energy equivalent to two million to three million tons of fossil fuel. Waste volumes are comparably scaled: fossil fuel systems generate hundreds of thousands of metric tons of gaseous, particulate and solid wastes, but nuclear systems produce less than 1,000 metric tons of high- and low-level waste per plant per year. The high-level waste is intensely radioactive at first, but its small volume means it can be and is effectively isolated and contained. When a nuclear plant is dismantled (few have been so far), the several hundred thousand tons of concrete, which is mildly radioactive, is buried in the same sort of commercial waste site used for radioactive medical and industrial wastes. Spent nuclear fuel loses radioactivity steadily; after 500 years it is no more radioactive than high-grade uranium ore. The risk of radioactive waste\u0027s seeping past multiple barriers would be small compared to health risks posed by air pollution from burning fossil fuels, which the World Health Organization estimates causes three million deaths a year, with 15,000 deaths annually in the United States from coal particulates alone. Substituting small, sequestered volumes of nuclear waste for vast, dispersed volumes of toxic wastes from fossil fuels could provide an enormous improvement in public health. The other risk that nuclear power supposedly raises is nuclear proliferation. In fact, no nation has developed nuclear weapons using plutonium from spent power reactor fuel. It\u0027s much easier to make weapons from plutonium bred specifically for that purpose. Inspection and proper accounting and control of nuclear materials are the answer to proliferation, not limits to nuclear power. France once burned coal; that nation\u0027s electricity is now 80 percent nuclear, with five times less air pollution and with carbon dioxide emissions 10 times lower than Germany\u0027s and 13 times lower than Denmark\u0027s. At a conference recently in Japan (another nuclear leader, with 36 percent nuclear electricity), French nuclear industry executive Anne Lanvergeon proposed improving the debate about nuclear power by creating an authoritative world database that would assess the advantages and disadvantages of each type of energy in terms of use of resources and economic, environmental and health impact. Measured against other energy sources, nuclear power would emerge at the top of such a list. Energy needs in the United States will grow in the coming decades, even with improved efficiency and more strenuous conservation. Nuclear energy needs to be a major component of our energy supply if we hope both to reduce air pollution and limit global warming.

As the nuclear weapon programs of North Korea, Pakistan, Israel, India and perhaps Iran have shown, civilian nuclear power programs are inextricably linked with the technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. We cannot promote nuclear power as a source of electricity and also expect to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation, a development that poses as great a threat to humanity as global warming. Furthermore, nuclear power is not an inexpensive bridge to an energy system based on renewable sources. It competes for resources with renewables, diverting money from the very technologies we need to promote. Numerous studies provide blueprints for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources more cheaply and quickly than nuclear power can. It is time to abandon the myth of the peaceful atom and focus on building a renewable energy system that meets the needs of all people. CATHERINE THOMASSON IRA HELFAND Leeds, Mass., May 3, 2014  The writers are, respectively, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility and co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which received the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. To the Editor: You are correct that there needs to be a rational balance between the risks of technology and the ultimate benefit, which in the case of nuclear power is supplying electricity while reducing the effect of climate change. The case for nuclear, as you say, lies in the drawbacks of the competition. There is no magic energy source despite how green the alternatives are. Where power is needed, there is only insufficient and intermittent wind and sun, and a real challenge to compete economically. Nuclear does need prudence, which has been well demonstrated in the United States, with reactors meeting exceptional safety standards. Independent, strict regulation works to make nuclear safe. It will allow nuclear power to make its contribution to controlling both polluting emissions and climate change. MICHAEL CORRADINI Madison, Wis., May 3, 2014  The writer is a professor of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. To the Editor: You do an excellent job of summing up the case for nuclear power. One critical point, however, is missing. The main reason that “competition from cheap natural gas” is a factor in the shutdown of nuclear plants is that the price of natural gas does not include externalities: the costs of the damage it causes to the environment by contributing to climate change. These are costs that society will have to bear in the future and that will only grow with time. And while natural gas causes less climate damage than coal, it is nevertheless unacceptable. Unless we tax carbon emissions, either directly or through a cap-and-trade system, the economic incentives for making the right choices will remain distorted. That is something we cannot afford. ZVI J. DORON Pittsburgh, May 2, 2014 The writer is a retired nuclear engineer and co-author of a book (in German) about energy and climate policies. To the Editor: You belittle “unfounded fears of using nuclear power.” To avoid nuclear power in the future is not an “unfounded fear” but a considered judgment based on nuclear disasters in three countries.

By Joseph A. Camilleri. 347 pp. Seattle: University of Washington Press. $25. THE debate over nuclear power has aroused intense feelings, but few attempts have been made to explain why. Joseph A. Camilleri, a senior lecturer in politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, sets out to correct this situation. In his well-documented \u0027\u0027The State and Nuclear Power,\u0027\u0027 he argues that the underlying cause of the public\u0027s disaffection with nuclear power has been the nature and extent of government intervention in its development and use, rather than the ostensible issues around which the debate has raged - weapons proliferation, waste disposal, reactor safety. He examines government\u0027s role in six countries - the United States, France, West Germany, Britain, Sweden and Brazil - that each developed different approaches to nuclear power. And he is able to show that the pace of development and the intensity of the debate differed from country to country. France, with its highly centralized political system and its commitment to an independent nuclear weapons program, took a more aggressive approach than West Germany, which had no weapons program and a less centralized government. By 1981, as a result, 40 percent of France\u0027s electricity was nuclear- generated - three times the proportion in the United States, Britain, or West Germany. In the United States and Britain, nuclear planning was at first closely related to military planning; civilian programs were developed as an afterthought or as a means of obscuring or popularizing the decision to acquire nuclear weapons. In America, opposition to nuclear power first focused on concerns about reactor safety and waste management. This opposition was intensified by fears that the nuclear authorities had been less than frank with the public about the dangers involved. By the early 1970\u0027s, these concerns were reinforced by questions about the economic viability of nuclear power. Opposition to nuclear power in Europe was more ideological than in America, but it was also provoked by dubious power plant economics and deceptive government propaganda. On both sides of the Atlantic, the antinuclear movement increasingly questioned one important rationale for government involvement with nuclear power - the need to support economic growth by expanding and centralizing energy supplies. Mr. Camilleri argues that the dispute about nuclear power is part of a larger conflict of values - an \u0027\u0027ideological confrontation between the center, which controls the productive process and uses the welfare state as the basis of capital accumulation, and the periphery sensitive to the destructive impact of the profit motivated post industrial system.\u0027\u0027 These concerns and the unfavorable economic outlook of the late 70\u0027s and early 80\u0027s made it difficult to maintain momentum behind nuclear programs. How much of the public\u0027s concern was attributable to changing economic conditions and how much to safety, waste management or broader ideological issues? To what extent did pressure for tighter regulations cause nuclear power plant economics to deteriorate? My reading of the American experience is that constantly changing and often conflicting regulatory policy was an important cause of the rising costs of nuclear plants. But Mr. Camilleri provides little evidence to help us sort this out. ANOTHER area that requires attention is the appropriate role of government in simultaneously promoting and regulating a new technology. Certainly, Congress, the State and Energy Departments and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rarely develop a consistent point of view; and this is probably healthy. Unfortunately, there are few mechanisms for resolving conflicts between agencies. Consequently, the nuclear industry finds it difficult to make the long-term commitments necessary to compete successfully. The public, on the other hand, becomes suspicious when it senses a reluctance on the part of the bureaucracy to deal with regulatory issues. Regrettably, \u0027\u0027The State and Nuclear Power\u0027\u0027 is not a good guide for managing future technological change. Even though the development of nuclear power cannot be judged a success so far, there are undoubtedly lessons we can learn from the experience. Mr. Camilleri helps us to understand the relationship between governments and the scientific and industrial communities. If he fails to offer guidance for the future, he has set the stage for others to do so.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/17/books/uglifying-the-atom.html","date":"Feb 17, 1985 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1366604509,"title":"Nuclear Power Safety","body":"To the Editor: The New York State Public Service Commission, the agency charged with overseeing the restructuring of New York\u0027s electric industry, should not rely on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to monitor nuclear safety since that commission was unable to ensure the safe operation of the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant (news article, Sept. 1).

A white paper on energy policy released after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday said that the government planned to have 40 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity installed by 2015, and pledged strict safety standards. While the white paper and state-controlled media did not describe this as a reduction in the target, the country’s current Five-Year Plan sets a target of 50 gigawatts. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, reaffirmed the target of 50 gigawatts in an interview in October 2011. That was when China resumed construction of nuclear power plants after a six-month hiatus following the Fukushima accident, which occurred after a tsunami flooded the Japanese nuclear power plant. China had 12.54 gigawatts of installed capacity of nuclear power plants at the end of last year, the white paper said. So the new, lower target still involves more than tripling current electricity generation from nuclear power. “China will invest more in nuclear power technological innovations, promote application of advanced technology, improve the equipment level, and attach great importance to personnel training,” the white paper said. The International Atomic Energy Agency and even Chinese regulators had expressed concern more than a year before the Fukushima accident that China’s nuclear power program was expanding so fast that it lacked enough skilled personnel to run so many reactors safely. While China’s military nuclear facilities tend to be deep in the country’s interior, a decision by the former leader Mao Zedong to help protect them from foreign attack, China has tended to build civilian nuclear reactors at isolated coastal locations — on peninsulas, where possible. According to Chinese nuclear engineers, that has been done to minimize the number of people nearby who might need to be evacuated in case of a serious accident, and to reduce the risk of contamination to supplies of fresh water. Before the Fukushima accident, the government had been planning to build civilian reactors in seven inland provinces as well, so the reactors would be close to large centers of electricity demand. Plans have been delayed, the government announced on Wednesday. Nuclear power generates only 1.8 percent of China’s electricity, far below the global average of 14 percent.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/25/business/global/china-reduces-target-for-construction-nuclear-power-plants.html","date":"Oct 25, 2012 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1471525767,"title":"EUROPE AFTER CHERNOBYL: COOLER ATTITUDES TOWARD NUCLEAR POWER","body":"A year after the Chernobyl disaster sent a cloud of radioactive debris drifting across much of Western Europe, those European countries already committed to nuclear power are pushing ahead with their nuclear programs. A year after the Chernobyl disaster sent a cloud of radioactive debris drifting across much of Western Europe, those European countries already committed to nuclear power are pushing ahead with their nuclear programs. Britain has just authorized construction of the first of a new generation of nuclear power reactors. West Germany recently started up a new reactor, its twenty-first. France - which leads the world by meeting 70 percent of its electrical consumption needs with nuclear energy - continues to build new reactors at a rate of about one every 18 months. Overall, Western Europe gets about one third of its electric power from nuclear reactors. Radiation levels have returned to normal over most of the continent, though the sale of reindeer meat and freshwater fish from northern Scandanavia is still banned. Pierre Pellerin, director of France\u0027s Central Protection Service Against Ion Radiation, asserted that \u0027\u0027the effect on European public health is rigorously nil.\u0027\u0027 In a report prepared for the European Community last month, however, Britain\u0027s National Radiological Protection Board said the Chernobyl accident may cause up to 1,000 cancer deaths in Western Europe over the next 70 years, although the percentage seems small when compared with the the 60 million cancer deaths that would have been expected. Changes in Attitudes Yet Chernobyl appears to have significantly affected Western European attitudes toward nuclear power. Opposition to nuclear power has hardened in many European countries. The Italian Parliament has halted work on the country\u0027s four unfinished reactors. Finland, Holland and Greece have canceled or postponed plans to acquire new reactors since Chernobyl. Sweden, which had already committed to abandoning nuclear power by 2010, now plans to shut a first reactor by 1995 and a second by 1996. And in nations that retain a commitment to nuclear energy, left-wing political parties have grown more adamant in their anti-nuclear statements, raising the possibility of a policy change if they come to power. Britain\u0027s Labor Party proposes to phase out nuclear power over several decades. West Germany\u0027s Social Democrats want to abolish it within 10 years. All Italian parties to the left of the Christian Democrats, the country\u0027s largest party, oppose nuclear power. Only in France is there still an all-party consensus in favor. \u0027\u0027For the first time a serious nuclear accident has become a real, not a theoretical, possibility,\u0027\u0027 said I. C. Bupp, the author of a new study on nuclear power after Chernobyl. \u0027\u0027That\u0027s bound to affect attitudes.\u0027\u0027 No Technical Changes Investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris concluded that the Chernobyl accident was specific to a particular type of Soviet reactor and did not call into question the safety of Western reactors. \u0027\u0027No new safety measures were needed on Western reactors,\u0027\u0027 said Thomas Roser of the Deutsches Atom Forum, a body representing Germany\u0027s atomic industry. As for reactors under construction, the impact of Chernobyl was lessened by the fact that the number of of reactors proposed or in progress has declined, since there is little demand for more electricity. West Germany has only three reactors still under construction. But in West Germany, authorities in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia are still blocking the start-up of a nearly completed reactor at Kalkar. France\u0027s latest reactor at Cattenom on its eastern frontier has provoked large and violent West German protests. While recent opinion polls show that West Germany\u0027s existing nuclear power plants now command the same majority support they enjoyed before Chernobyl, they also show rising opposition to building any new nuclear reactors in the future. Although Britain\u0027s Conservative Government is pushing ahead with construction of Sizewell B, the first of a planned series of new-model reactors, political opposition to the program appears strong at the local level and there are signs that the Government is quietly scaling back its plans. French Consensus Wavers Even France\u0027s traditional political consensus in favor of nuclear power has been shaken by recent accidents at its Super Phenix fast breeder reactor and at a uranium enrichment plant. The opposition Socialists have demanded the creation of an independent commission to oversee safety at nuclear plants and the leading trade union has called for Super Phenix to be shut down until the cause of a leak is found. A recent poll found that 53 percent of the French questioned would try to move if a nuclear power station were built nearby. With Europe\u0027s power needs now largely satisfied it is only in the mid 1990\u0027s that a significant new demand for generating capacity is expected to arise. Siemens, West Germany\u0027s biggest nuclear reactor constructor, and France\u0027s state-owned nuclear constructor both believe that new demand for nuclear power stations will develop then. But other experts like Mr. Bupp think Chernobyl has produced \u0027\u0027a subtle shift\u0027\u0027 in attitudes toward nuclear power among politicians and business executives. He predicts that Europe will gradually follow the example of the United States, where the last new reactor order was placed in 1973, and move toward natural gas and coal-fired electrical generators.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9B0DE2DB103EF934A15757C0A961948260","date":"Apr 27, 1987 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-2065336680,"title":"Role of Nuclear Power Is Disputed Despite Looming Energy Shortage","body":"As the 1990\u0027s begin, the nuclear power industry and its most vocal critics agree that the United States faces a new energy shortage, but they remain at odds over the role that nuclear power should play in averting a crisis. As the 1990\u0027s begin, the nuclear power industry and its most vocal critics agree that the United States faces a new energy shortage, but they remain at odds over the role that nuclear power should play in averting a crisis. In a report assessing nuclear power in the last decade, environmental groups contend that the industry has not proven it can stand on its own economically or deal with the problems of safety and waste disposal. The report, \u0027\u0027A Decade of Decline: The Degeneration of Nuclear Power in the 1980\u0027s and the Emergence of Safer Energy Alternatives,\u0027\u0027 was made public on Thursday. It was prepared by Ralph Nader\u0027s Public Citizen organization on behalf of several dozen environmental and anti-nuclear power groups around the country. New Fuel Shortage Looms The makings of an energy shortage in the new decade are not in dispute. Domestic oil production has fallen 13 percent since the Arab oil embargo in 1973, and oil imports have taken up the slack. Moreover, the possibility of global warming, which is caused the burning of fossil fuels and depletes the ozone layer, poses a potential threat to the environment and could force the nation to restrict the use of oil, coal and natural gas. \u0027\u0027The nuclear industry is now seeking to exploit this situation by portraying itself as the solution to the nation\u0027s energy and environmental woes,\u0027\u0027 the report said. Despite the promises of nuclear power, critics contend, the industry has grown more costly, safety has not improved and the problem of radioactive waste has not been solved. Responding to the report, proponents of nuclear plants said in interviews that as the cost of imported oil rises and domestic production shrinks, the industry will become more competitive and part of the solution to the energy crisis. But serious obstacles remain. In the last decade there were no orders for new nuclear reactors. Documents obtained from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy show that eight licensed reactors were closed and 60 that had been ordered or were under construction were cancelled. At the same time the cost of construction for new plants, not accounting for inflation, rose from $1,135 per kilowatt in 1980 to $4,590 in 1989, the report said. The cost of most \u0027\u0027renewable\u0027\u0027 sources of energy, like hydroelectric, solar and wind power, declined, and their electric generating capacity grew by 27 percent, producing more power than nuclear plants. New Plants Said to Be Cheaper But industry officials say that the financial picture is improving and that in some cases nuclear power is cheaper than other sources. \u0027\u0027Of course, the viable option is going to depend upon economics,\u0027\u0027 said Richard Slember, vice president of Energy Systems at the Westinghouse Corporation, one of the nation\u0027s largest manufacturers of commercial nuclear reactors. The current generation of plants is cheaper, more efficient and much safer than previous designs, Mr. Slember said. Plants that began operating in the 1980\u0027s were expensive because of high interest rates, exorbitant construction costs and new safety requirements after the accident at Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, said Cathy Steel Roche, media director at the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the industry\u0027s main trade organization. \u0027\u0027With those costs now under control, our belief is that nuclear power will be economically competitive.\u0027\u0027 The major stumbling block to the wider use of nuclear power, the industry contends, is not the plants but the regulatory process that has forced them to sit idle. \u0027\u0027It\u0027s going to take some sort of crisis,\u0027\u0027 said John Sillin of the Management Analysis Company in Washington, a consulting firm to the nuclear industry. \u0027\u0027The state licensing commissions will only come around when the brownouts continue and get worse.\u0027\u0027 But the report said the public is most concerned because it thinks the plants are neither safe nor reliable. Indeed, public support for nuclear power withered after the incidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl in the Soviet Union.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9C0CE3D91E3AF931A35752C0A966958260","date":"Jan 2, 1990 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":2006781634,"title":"Toshiba May Buy Westinghouse for $5 Billion","body":"Toshiba May Buy Westinghouse for $5 Billion After weeks of a fierce bidding war, the Toshiba Corporation of Japan is near a deal to buy Westinghouse Electric, a builder of nuclear power plants, for about $5 billion, a person involved in the talks said yesterday. Toshiba beat competing bids from General Electric, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and it is in exclusive talks with Westinghouse, this person said. Westinghouse, based in Monroeville, Pa., is controlled by British Nuclear Fuels, which in turn is controlled by the British government. Mitsubishi made an offer of more than $2.5 billion for Westinghouse last summer, and The Wall Street Journal reported last week that G.E. and Hitachi had teamed up to make a $3.5 billion bid. But Toshiba made a last-minute, higher offer, the person said. Nuclear energy is gaining support with governments around the world amid high oil and natural gas prices, tight petroleum supplies and growing demand for electricity. Technology by Westinghouse is found in half the world\u0027s operating commercial nuclear power plants, according to the company\u0027s Web site. The company has 8,500 employees. Since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, no new nuclear power-plants have been built in the United States. Opponents of nuclear power say the 1986 explosion of the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine and the problems associated with the disposal of waste fuel illustrate the dangers of nuclear energy for the environment. But elsewhere, nuclear energy never lost the favor of governments who view it as a reliable source of energy. Even in the United States, the appeal of nuclear power has risen as prices for natural gas and coal, which power most of America\u0027s power plants, have risen in recent months. Energy companies are seeking licenses around the country to build new power plants, notably in Alabama and Mississippi. The Bush administration, which is also encouraging the development of nuclear energy as a way to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, is seeking to streamline the application process and permits needed to build new plants. British Nuclear bought Westinghouse\u0027s nuclear business from the CBS Corporation for $1.1 billion in 1999, ridding the company of its last industrial vestige. The sale completed the transformation of what was once called the Westinghouse Electric Corporation into a media conglomerate. The sale of Westinghouse to a Japanese company may raise security concerns at a time when Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear program of its own. Worldwide, there are 443 nuclear plants used for electricity generation in 31 countries, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Of these, 103 are in the United States, where they account for about a fifth of power production. Twenty-four new nuclear plants are under construction in 10 countries.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9D0DE3DA133FF930A15752C0A9609C8B63","date":"Jan 23, 2006 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":2016060303,"title":"U.S. Nuclear Push May Be in Peril","body":"WASHINGTON — The fragile bipartisan consensus that nuclear power offers a big piece of the answer to America’s energy and global warming challenges may have evaporated as quickly as confidence in Japan’s crippled nuclear reactors. Until this weekend, President Obama, mainstream environmental groups and large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed that nuclear power offered a steady energy source and part of the solution to climate change, even as they disagreed on virtually every other aspect of energy policy. Mr. Obama is seeking tens of billions of dollars in government insurance for new nuclear construction, and the nuclear industry in the United States, all but paralyzed for decades after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, was poised for a comeback. Now, that is all in question as the world watches the unfolding crisis in Japan’s nuclear reactors and the widespread terror it has spawned. “I think it calls on us here in the U.S., naturally, not to stop building nuclear power plants but to put the brakes on right now until we understand the ramifications of what’s happened in Japan,” Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and one of the Senate’s leading voices on energy, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Nuclear power, which still suffers from huge economic uncertainties and local concerns about safety, had been growing in acceptance as what appeared to many to be a relatively benign, proven and (if safe and permanent storage for wastes could be arranged) nonpolluting source of energy for the United States’ future growth. But even staunch supporters of nuclear power are now advocating a pause in licensing and building new reactors in the United States to make sure that proper safety and evacuation measures are in place. Environmental groups are reassessing their willingness to see nuclear power as a linchpin of any future climate change legislation. Mr. Obama still sees nuclear power as a major element of future American energy policy, but he is injecting a new tone of caution into his endorsement. “The president believes that meeting our energy needs means relying on a diverse set of energy sources that includes renewables like wind and solar, natural gas, clean coal and nuclear power,” said Clark Stevens, a White House spokesman. “Information is still coming in about the events unfolding in Japan, but the administration is committed to learning from them and ensuring that nuclear energy is produced safely and responsibly here in the U.S.” Three of the world’s chief sources of large-scale energy production — coal, oil and nuclear power — have all experienced eye-popping accidents in just the past year. The Upper Big Branch coal mine explosion in West Virginia, the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the unfolding nuclear crisis in Japan have dramatized the dangers of conventional power generation at a time when the world has no workable alternatives able to operate at sufficient scale. The policy implications for the United States are vexing. “It’s not possible to achieve a climate solution based on existing technology without a significant reliance on nuclear power,” said Jason Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and an energy and climate change adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. “It’s early to reach many conclusions about what happened in Japan and the relevance of what happened to the United States. But the safety of nuclear power will certainly be high on the list of questions for the next several months.” “The world is fundamentally a set of relative risks,” Mr. Grumet added, noting the confluence of disasters in coal mining, oil drilling and nuclear plant operations. “The accident certainly has diminished what had been a growing impetus in the environmental community to support nuclear power as part of a broad bargain on energy and climate policy.” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said that the United States should not overreact to the Japanese nuclear crisis by clamping down on the domestic industry indefinitely. Republicans have loudly complained that the Obama administration did just that after the BP oil spill last spring when it imposed a moratorium on deepwater oil drilling until new safety and environmental rules were written. “I don’t think right after a major environmental catastrophe is a very good time to be making American domestic policy,” Mr. McConnell said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said that the American public and politicians had recoiled after Three Mile Island, rejecting permits for the construction of dozens of nuclear plants on the “not in my backyard” impulse. “My thought about it is, we ought not to make American and domestic policy based upon an event that happened in Japan,” Mr. McConnell said. Mr. Obama has been as supportive of nuclear power as any recent president as he has tried to devise a political and technical strategy for ensuring energy supplies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power, along with expanded offshore oil drilling, “clean coal” development and extensive support for renewable energy, are part of his “all-of-the-above energy strategy,” an approach and terminology borrowed from Republicans. But his support for coal and oil as part of a grand compromise on energy were set back by last year’s mining and drilling disasters, and today’s problems with nuclear in Japan cannot help. Concerns about earthquakes and nuclear power have been around for a long time; new questions might also be raised now about tsunamis and coastal reactors. In Mr. Obama’s State of the Union address and in his budget, he proposed an expansion of nuclear energy technology and $36 billion in Department of Energy loan guarantees for the construction of as many as 20 new nuclear plants. That policy will be on the table at a hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, when Steven Chu, the energy secretary, and Gregory B. Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are scheduled to testify. “We will use that opportunity to explore what is known in the early aftermath of the damage to Japanese nuclear facilities,” said Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, the committee chairman, “as well as to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the safety of U.S. nuclear sites.” Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a skeptic of nuclear power who nonetheless supported expansion of nuclear power as part of the House energy and climate legislation he co-sponsored, said the United States needed tougher standards for siting and operating nuclear plants. He said regulators should consider a moratorium on locating nuclear plants in seismically active areas, require stronger containment vessels in earthquake-prone regions and thoroughly review the 31 plants in the United States that use similar technology to the crippled Japanese reactors. “The unfolding disaster in Japan must produce a seismic shift in how we address nuclear safety here in America,” Mr. Markey said.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/science/earth/14politics.html","date":"Mar 14, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1283860024,"title":"Of Climate Change and Nuclear Power","body":"Nuclear power should play an essential role in our efforts to mitigate climate change, argues Stewart Brand, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog and longtime environmental activist. Mr. Brand, a professed “eco-pragmatist,” makes the case for nuclear power in his latest book, “ The Whole Earth Discipline ,” where he draws on the work of several scientists, including Saul Griffith , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained material scientist and inventor. While acknowledging that nuclear power is not without its own environmental risks, Mr. Brand said his bigger concern is the damage caused by coal-burning power plants. To mitigate this damage, he argues we must cut our fossil fuel use to a fraction of today’s levels over the next 25 years. Renewables, energy efficiency and conservation will play their parts in our future clean-energy portfolio, Mr. Brand said, but given the 25-year time frame, technologies like wind, solar and biofuels cannot supply enough reliable, consistent electric power to take enough fossil fuel plants offline. “The vileness of nuclear weapons easily smears over to nuclear energy, and there you have it,” Mr. Brand wrote in an e-mail message. “Emotion replaces thought and practicality.” Not everyone agrees that it’s purely an emotional issue. Amory Lovins, a physicist and the chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute , wrote a polite, but detailed dissection of Brand’s position last week: Today, most dispassionate analysts think new nuclear power plants’ deepest flaw is their economics. They cost too much to build and incur too much financial risk. My writings show why nuclear expansion therefore can’t deliver on its claims: it would reduce and retard climate protection, because it saves between two and 20 times less carbon per dollar, 20 to 40 times slower, than investing in efficiency and micropower. Mr. Lovins said he favored expanding the use of renewables and decentralizing the power grid by developing more local sources of power generation. Meanwhile, Jim Riccio, a Greenpeace spokesman, in a conversation with Green Inc., called Mr. Brand’s arguments “nonsensical, especially concerning the abysmal economics of nuclear power.” Mr. Riccio added: “I don’t question his motives. But you get so desperate to solve climate change you begin clutching at nuclear straws.” Greenpeace argues that energy efficiency will provide the biggest impact in the near term, followed by renewables. It also sees natural gas as a “bridge fuel” to be used while phasing out coal, oil — and nuclear power. Still, the recent Kerry-Boxer climate-change bill recently introduced in the Senate would provide strong support for nuclear power in the nation’s energy mix. And one of the United Nations working groups trying to prepare a global climate deal ahead of the international summit in Copenhagen in December is considering proposals to include nuclear power in the Clean Development Mechanism . The Clean Development Mechanism is an element of the Kyoto protocol that allows developed countries to gain credits against their greenhouse gas reduction commitments by building emission reduction projects in developing countries. Previously, nuclear power projects have not qualified for the program. “I presume that nuclear power will qualify for carbon credits this time, the way it didn’t at Kyoto,” Mr. Brand said. “The salutary French experience with nuclear is geographically and politically close enough to Copenhagen to assure that, I trust.” If this happens, Mr. Brand predicted that many of his critics could become “reluctant tolerators.”","url":"https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/","date":"Oct 23, 2009 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1020648808,"title":"Nuclear Phobia Over Shoreham","body":"NUCLEAR power plants have generally performed safely during the last 34 years, with only one major accident, at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, and one minor accident, at Three Mile Island in the United States.

As of July 1, 105 United States nuclear power plants were in commercial operation. That includes 6 in New York State. The first American plant, in Pennsylvania, began delivering electrical power in 1955 and was retired in 1982. In the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979, a loss of reactor coolant resulted in a partial, but completely contained, melting of the nuclear fuel. The two million people living in the area were exposed to radiation of about 1 millirem, an insignificant level. A chest X-ray of less than one second exposes a person to 40 millirems. The maximum dose to any person close to the site was between 40 and 100 millirem. This level is tolerable, because an average person\u0027s radiation exposure on Long Island over one year is 150 millirems. No observable effects occur when the radiation level is 25,000 millirems or less. The presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident concluded that the main health effect was short-term mental stress, including confusion, concern and fear. The commission found no physical harm. Even so, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has enacted many new plant requirements prompting thousands of changes in the nuclear power industry. As of May 5, 303 commercial nuclear power plants were operating outside the United States. In 1954, the first plant started up in the Soviet Union. Since then, a number of technologically advanced nations have generated much of their electrical power from nuclear fuel. France leads, with 70 percent, followed by Belgium, with 66 percent. West Germany and Japan use nuclear plants for 31 percent of their electrical power. Only 18 percent of our power is from nuclear plants. The 1986 accident at Chernobyl was the result of a flawed reactor design and the failure of the plant\u0027s operators to abide by safety procedures. The Soviet operators disengaged several safety systems, allowing an uncontrolled power surge, combined with reduced reactor coolant flow. Also, the reactor\u0027s control rods responded too slowly to prevent the sudden rise in power. Finally, the reactor was not fully contained, so radioactive materials escaped and fires began. Commercial nuclear plants in the United States have none of the deficiencies that led to the Chernobyl accident, according to the United States Government, the nuclear industry and the insurance companies that underwrite nuclear plant policies. A Soviet academician who led the Soviet delegation at the Vienna conference where the accident was discussed was asked: \u0027\u0027Could Chernobyl happen here?\u0027\u0027 He said such an accident was simply not possible in any commercial reactor outside the Soviet Union. The Chernobyl accident caused 31 deaths of workers at the plant, firemen and other rescue personnel. None of the 135,000 Soviet citizens evacuated during the accident have, as of February, shown any symptoms of health problems. All of us take life-threatening risks every day. For example, no mode of transportation is 100 percent safe, yet we travel extensively by car, bus, train and airplane. Though lives are lost each year in travel accidents, we continue to use these forms of transportation because the risk is reasonably small. So it is with nuclear power generation. As noted above, the safety record of operating nuclear power plants is quite good. To minimize risk, the Shoreham plant has many noteworthy safety features, including: * Five physical barriers to contain radioactive materials within the plant during normal operation and even during an accident. * A reactor protector system to immediately and automatically shut the reactor if certain operating conditions exceed safety limits. * Four emergency core cooling systems. * Six emergency diesel generators to shut the plant if all off-site power sources are lost in a hurricane or other catastrophic event. Finally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has done extensive inspections at Shoreham and has found it to be well constructed and safe. Thus, fear of an accident at the Shoreham site is not well founded. Compared with burning coal, gas or oil for electrical power, nuclear power generation has considerably less environmental impact. The Shoreham plant should be allowed to operate for at least one year to provide the basis to project ratepayer costs.

While the German public has been the most vocal against nuclear power — pushing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government this week to close temporarily seven of the country’s 17 plants — it is a different story in other parts of Europe. France, the second-largest producer of nuclear power in the world behind the United States, said it would continue to rely on nuclear energy. President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that the accident in Japan had “provoked across the world a number of questions about the safety of nuclear power stations and the energy mix.” But he added: “France has chosen nuclear energy, which is an essential element of its energy independence and the struggle against greenhouse gases.” He added: “I remain convinced of the relevance today of those choices.” Nonetheless, critics voiced their opposition to the government’s stance. François Mativet, a spokesman for Sortir du Nucléaire, a network of 875 antinuclear groups, described Mr. Sarkozy’s comments as “scandalous” and called for the immediate closing of 16 reactors in France that have been in service for more than 30 years, as well as a longer-term plan to abandon nuclear power. Elsewhere on the Continent, Russia and several Eastern European countries were playing down the risk of nuclear power. So confident was Russia that it signed an agreement with Belarus this week to finance and build Belarus’s first nuclear power plant, a 4.3 billion euro, or $6 billion, project near the Lithuanian border. As if to make a point that Russia had no intention of backing away from its own ambitious nuclear energy policy, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin flew to Minsk for the signing ceremony on Tuesday. “We now have a whole arsenal of progressive technological means to ensure the stable accident-free work of nuclear power stations,” Mr. Putin said. The Belarusian plant will have two reactors. They are expected to begin operating by 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich of Belarus said at the ceremony. Belarus’s neighbors in the European Union — Lithuania, Latvia and Poland — expressed concern about the accord, not only because it would increase Belarus’s dependence on Russia for its energy but also because of safety concerns. The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, contaminated parts of these countries, as well as Belarus. Despite such fears, Lithuania and Poland seem determined to go ahead with their own nuclear programs, if they can afford it. The Lithuanian government has said it wants to replace the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was partly closed in 2004 for safety reasons at the insistence of the European Union, which required it as a condition for joining. Still, Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania’s president, said this week that the government might have to rethink its nuclear energy plans, not because of Japan’s disasters but because of costs. “Lithuania should have no illusions that it may be able to build something in the near future; we have no investor,” Mrs. Grybauskaite told The Associated Press. “We have no technologies. It would be very naïve nurturing expectations, especially given the current situation and the economic crisis, which isn’t over yet.” In Poland, which is considering building its own nuclear power plants, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also played down the crisis in Japan. “Plants will be built to provide maximum security,” he told reporters last weekend. A similar attitude can be seen in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, where public opinion, with few exceptions, has not questioned such a strategy. All those countries intend to build more nuclear plants, despite the costs — and despite the increased dependence on Russia for the construction of these plants or for uranium. In China, the government announced stepped-up inspections at its existing plants in addition to the suspension of new approvals. China, the world’s leader in construction of nuclear plants, plans to add more than 25 reactors, but most are already under construction, and it was unclear how many would be affected by the new order. The announcement came after Premier Wen Jiabao discussed Japan’s nuclear crisis with the State Council, a body roughly equivalent to the White House cabinet. “We must fully grasp the importance and urgency of nuclear safety, and development of nuclear power must make safety the top priority,” the government said on its Web site. “Any hazards must be thoroughly dealt with, and those that do not conform to safety standards must immediately cease construction.” Although the statement said \"all new power plants\" should be suspended until safety standards are revised, an industry expert said Thursday morning that the government intends to continue work on those plants already under construction and halt construction only if it identifies safety problems. In that case, China’s expansion of nuclear power might not slow significantly, he said. Officials have portrayed nuclear energy as a way for China to reduce its reliance on coal and cut its carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time meeting surging demand for electricity. The country has never had a serious nuclear accident, though the speed of its construction program has raised safety concerns. Some specialists also worried that China was building plants too close to urban areas or earthquake fault lines. In late February, just a few weeks before the crisis at Japan’s Daiichi nuclear complex began to unfold, China’s ministry of environmental protection announced regulations prohibiting nuclear construction near earthquake zones or major cities. As recently as Saturday, before the gravity of the nuclear disaster in Japan was clear, a top Chinese official restated China’s commitment to nuclear power. “Some lessons we learn from Japan will be considered in the making of China’s nuclear power plans,” Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, said then . “But China will not change its determination and plan for developing nuclear power.” He also said that China used a more modern design than those of Japan’s stricken reactors.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/business/global/17atomic.html","date":"Mar 16, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":201530145,"title":"The Debate Over Nuclear Power","body":"To the Editor: Your opinion that \u0027\u0027more than a few people in the green camp embrace nuclear plants as a proven, readily available way to reduce carbon emissions\u0027\u0027 (\u0027\u0027The Nuclear Option,\u0027\u0027 editorial, April 3) doesn\u0027t apply to anyone in the \u0027\u0027green camp\u0027\u0027 who is informed about the fossil-fuel-intensive life cycle of nuclear power.

The Bush administration\u0027s energy task force announces its report today, and President Bush would do well to note the public\u0027s concerns about the combination of human fallibility and mechanical failure that can set off catastrophic accidents at nuclear plants and about the link between nuclear waste and nuclear weapons. The nuclear industry\u0027s safety and security claims are often misleading. Its spokesmen still insist that the Three Mile Island accident demonstrated that the core of a light water reactor is far more resistant to a meltdown than had been previously thought. They don\u0027t acknowledge that the core at the Three Mile Island plant was within hours of an uncontrolled melt -- with Chernobyl-like consequences -- when a new shift supervisor came on duty in a panicked control room and finally figured out that thousands of gallons of cooling water had poured undetected from a valve that was stuck open. Advanced designs for presumably safer light water reactors and simpler pebble-bed reactors still have not made it off the drawing boards. Though the nuclear industry claims it is being crippled by overregulation, its powerful friends on Capitol Hill have threatened budget cuts to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission compliant. The N.R.C. has begun a process of granting life extension to America\u0027s aging supply of 104 power reactors, for example, despite a rash of forced shutdowns due to equipment failures caused by aging. There have been at least eight such shutdowns over the past 16 months, according to an analysis of N.R.C. data by the Union of Concerned Scientists. And the agency has decided not to take enforcement action against weak security at nuclear plants: guards at half the nation\u0027s nuclear power plants have failed to repel mock attackers in N.R.C.-supervised exercises that test the protection of reactor safety systems against sabotage. Instead, it is in the process of weakening the rules of the \u0027\u0027game\u0027\u0027 used in the mock attacks. A push for nuclear power, which Mr. Bush supports, isn\u0027t the way to meet America\u0027s urgent energy needs. New plants could not be brought on line quickly enough to offset present electricity shortages, which many experts believe are caused primarily by lack of capacity for transmission, not production. Nor could using nuclear plants make a big dent in global warming. Two-thirds of the emissions of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, are from transportation or other sources not related to power generation. And worldwide, it would take 3,000 nuclear plants -- a tenfold increase -- to replace all coal plants; yet that increase would reduce carbon emissions by only 20 percent, while enormously expanding risks that materials from nuclear power plants would be applied to making weapons. And since reserves of uranium ore are limited, millions of kilograms of plutonium, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of bombs, would have to be separated from wastes each year to help fuel so many reactors in the future. There are better alternatives. Energy efficiency measures, like using the best available existing technology for air conditioning, lighting and electric motors, could offset the need to build any new nuclear plants. Renewable energy sources and other alternative energy systems, including hydrogen recovered from fossil fuels after removing carbon, could provide new, clean ways to generate power. A rapid expansion of nuclear power would compound the existing dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation. International inspections of nuclear facilities provide uncertain protection; Iran, for example, has pledged to put the reactors it will build under inspection but is still suspected of using civilian nuclear power as a cover for a nascent nuclear weapons program. George Perkovich, in his book \u0027\u0027India\u0027s Nuclear Bomb,\u0027\u0027 reports that a bomb tested by India in 1998 was made from the grade of plutonium produced in its 10 uninspected power reactors. Is it reasonable to assume that millions of kilograms of plutonium, separated from reactor wastes, can be kept secure, down to amounts of less than eight kilograms, which is all that is needed for an atomic bomb that terrorists and radical states could make? This is the ultimate question requiring an answer before nuclear power is looked to as the solution to climate and energy worries. Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, was codirector of the Senate investigation of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9500E0DB133AF934A25756C0A9679C8B63","date":"May 17, 2001 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-2068876111,"title":"Soviet Scraps a New Atomic Plant In Face of Protest Over Chernobyl","body":"The Soviet authorities have abandoned construction of a nuclear power plant near the Black Sea in the face of public opposition generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl atomic power station, a Soviet newspaper reported today. The Soviet authorities have abandoned construction of a nuclear power plant near the Black Sea in the face of public opposition generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl atomic power station, a Soviet newspaper reported today. The newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, also disclosed that all of the 20 operating nuclear power plants in the country and most of those under construction were now \u0027\u0027bitterly opposed\u0027\u0027 by local residents. The report on the abandoned project near the city of Krasnodar was the strongest official acknowledgment that since the Chernobyl accident public opinion here had turned sharply against nuclear power and posed a serious threat to the country\u0027s ambitious nuclear energy program. Protests Reported Unofficially \u0027\u0027The Krasnodar nuclear power plant is perhaps the first to witness this, but it is not the only one,\u0027\u0027 the newspaper said. Public protests against the siting of nuclear power plants have been described in underground publications, but the controversy has only been hinted at in the official press. In late November the head of a Soviet commission investigating the Chernobyl disaster told a Frankfurt environmental magazine that public protests had blocked plans for new nuclear plants near Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, and near the Black Sea port of Odessa. If that is so, it has not been officially announced here. The commission official spoke during a visit to West Germany. \u0027Unprecedented\u0027 Action Komsomolskaya Pravda said the abandonment of the Krasnodar project was \u0027\u0027unprecedented\u0027\u0027 and had caused nuclear power officials to fear \u0027\u0027a chain reaction\u0027\u0027 that would threaten other projects. Since the Chernobyl accident, Soviet officials have repeatedly declared their intention of pushing ahead with a construction program that is meant to double nuclear power output by the year 2000. At that point, according to the official timetable, nuclear power would account for more than 20 percent of the country\u0027s electricity. The Komsomolskaya Pravda report said $41 million had already been spent on the new Krasnodar plant before local officials bowed to a flood of letters from local residents and decided at the end of last year to cancel it. The newspaper did not provide the precise location of the plant, the state of construction or details of its planned output and type. The plant is not mentioned in recent Soviet reports, indicating it must be quite new. Like officials in many Soviet localities, the newspaper said, leaders in the Krasnodar region had pleaded with Moscow two years ago for financing to build a nuclear plant to meet an expected shortage of electricity in the northern Caucusus Mountains. \u0027\u0027Before Chernobyl, to have a nuclear power plant was profitable - and also prestigious,\u0027\u0027 the newspaper said. \u0027\u0027In addition to providing self-dependency in energy, a nuclear power plant guaranteed increased attention toward the region, including jobs, housing and social and cultural amenities. \u0027\u0027But then the entire world started talking about Chernobyl.\u0027\u0027 Thirty-one people died when the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl exploded and burned as the reactor raged out of control during an experimental shutdown of the cooling system. The explosion rained radioactive particles on surrounding Ukrainian towns and farmland, and contaminated farmlands as far away as Poland and Sweden. The accident forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents. Until today\u0027s report, the explosion seemed, in the view of Western analysts, to have set back Western nuclear power programs more severely than the Soviet program. \u0027Situation Is Not Surprising\u0027 The shock of Chernobyl brought new determination to anti-nuclear groups in the United States and Europe. \u0027\u0027I think the situation today is not surprising,\u0027\u0027 the Komsomolskaya Pravda reporter wrote. \u0027\u0027We have read about the anti-nuclear demonstrations in other countries, and about the referendum in Austria in which it was decided not to build nuclear power plants at all, and about the fears connected with this in the United States.\u0027\u0027 The Soviet authorities have worked intensively since the Chernobyl accident to assure the public that nuclear power is safe and that their program would stay on course. The three remaining Chernobyl reactors have been brought back on line, and new safety measures have been adopted at other nuclear power plants, including installation of more safety equipment and intensive training courses for plant employees. Soviet officials have announced that they would not build any more reactors of the type that failed at Chernobyl. The reactor model uses graphite to \u0027\u0027moderate\u0027\u0027 or help sustain the fission of its nuclear fuel. Most nuclear power plants in the United States are of a different design in which water moderates the nuclear reaction. Swedes visiting Moscow this week were reportedly told that plans for seven graphite-moderated reactors had been scrapped, including the fifth and sixth reactors for Chernobyl. Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper of the Young Communists\u0027 League, argued that critics of nuclear power were misguided. The paper said that the northern Caucasus would face a shortage of eight million kilowatts of electricity by the year 2000, and that building coal-burning power plants instead, as residents propose, would bring pollution to the fertile Kuban Valley.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d940DEEDF1F3CF93BA15752C0A96E948260","date":"Jan 28, 1988 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1835548071,"title":"Toshiba Buying British Maker of Reactors","body":"Making a big bet on the future of nuclear power, Toshiba of Japan agreed on Monday to buy Westinghouse Electric, the atomic energy division of British Nuclear Fuels, for $5.4 billion.

Nuclear power is increasingly seen as an alternative to energy sources like coal and oil, as energy demand increases around the world.

Westinghouse estimates that half of the world\u0027s nuclear plants and 60 percent of those in the United States use its technology. In a sign of the new demand for nuclear power, China alone plans to build more than 25 nuclear power plants by 2020, and the government is said to prefer the pressurized-water reactors that Westinghouse manufactures. Toshiba is already a leading manufacturer of another commonly used type of reactor, which uses boiling water. Toshiba said that it would acquire all of Westinghouse but that it was in discussions to sell minority stakes to other companies, which it did not identify. Toshiba estimates its nuclear business will triple by 2015 because of the deal. The company said it would pay for the purchase over three years, using available cash flow.

Sales of iodine pills to limit the absorption of radiation surged briskly, too, propelled by anxiety that people might find themselves engulfed in clouds of long-range radioactive fallout. No matter that the incipient nuclear catastrophe was about 5,500 miles away, or that Germany, unlike Japan, did not lie on known tectonic fault lines. On the streets of major cities, hundreds of thousands of protesters, casting events in Japan as a portent of what might happen here, turned out ahead of state elections to demand a halt to Germany’s own nuclear power program, the source of nearly a quarter of the nation’s electricity. Those two intertwined phenomena — angst and electoral maneuvering — led to what seemed one of the most abrupt reversals of Angela Merkel’s years as German chancellor: On Monday, she abandoned plans laid only nine months earlier to extend the life of the country’s nuclear power stations and ordered instead that they be phased out by 2022 . The decision meant that, at Europe’s heart, the Continent’s economic powerhouse had committed itself far more radically than its neighbors to the east or west to replace nuclear power with renewable sources of energy like wind turbines — or at least, critics said, with nuclear-generated power imported from neighbors like France. But the German move also raised a question whose answer seemed elusive: What is there in this land of 82 million people that has, over decades, bred an aversion to nuclear energy that seems unrivaled among its economic peers, defying its reputation for reasoned debate? “Just as creationists attempt to ban the theory of evolution from the school books,” said a physicist, Peter Heller, in a Web posting that challenged the national nuclear orthodoxy, “it almost seems as if every factual and neutral explanation in Germany is now in the process of being deleted” from the nuclear debate. Indeed, said Reinhard Wolf, a professor in Frankfurt, the debate is so passionate that “you are either with us or against us.” “There is no middle ground,” Professor Wolf said. The power of antinuclear sentiment has already redrawn the politics of survival for Mrs. Merkel. Recent regional elections in the southern state of Baden-Württemberg and in the northern city-state of Bremen have undermined her conservative Christian Democratic Union to the benefit of the antinuclear Green Party. The Greens’ showing was so strong it seemed that if national elections were held now, they would emerge again as kingmakers, as they were before Mrs. Merkel came to power in 2005. Within days of that fundamental shift, her energy policy, once firmly based on extending the life of Germany’s nuclear plants, swung around in favor of closing the plants much sooner. As she said after the Fukushima crisis began, events in Japan changed “everything in Germany.” When Mrs. Merkel on Monday announced her plans to phase out all of Germany’s 17 nuclear reactors, said Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development here, she courted the danger “that when a government reacts too quickly to an incident like Fukishima, it creates the impression that there is no real reason except winning votes.” “The government has decided to listen to the anxiety of the people and go to the position where the opposition wants them to go,” Mr. Gigerenzer said in a telephone interview. Some call the process Merkelism, defined by the columnist Roland Nelles in the weekly Der Spiegel as politics “based on two principles.”  “The first is that, if the people want it, it must be right,” Mr. Nelles wrote. “The second is that whatever is useful to the people must also be useful to the chancellor.” That calculation seemed borne out by opinion surveys suggesting that around 70 percent of Germans believed that their chancellor was maneuvering for electoral advantage. The same proportion, significantly, said they were prepared to pay higher electricity bills in return for ending nuclear energy. That again seemed to underscore the way the nuclear debate here draws such apocalyptic comparisons. “What Sept. 11, 2001, meant for the vulnerability of the West,” the center-left Süddeutsche Zeitung said, for instance, the catastrophe in Japan on March 11, 2011, “will mean for the idea that nuclear power is controllable. That idea can no longer be supported.” Of course, few modern German reflexes are completely free of what Professor Wolf in Frankfurt called “the German experience” of its Nazi past, which has made many suspicious of the industrialization of destructive forces, whether chemical or nuclear. Some date the roots of Germany’s Greens movement — a leading opponent of nuclear power — even further back, to the romanticism of the 19th century, and the hankering for forests and a wholesome, perfect world. That may seem fanciful to some. But there is little doubt that Germany’s modern history has combined to produce a deep strain of risk aversion, of caution, and a dislike for surprises, all of which magnify the potential hazards of nuclear energy, producing a perception that is different from that of other major European economies like France or Britain, commentators said. “The dramatic events in Japan demonstrate that nuclear power can’t be controlled completely,” said Claudia Roth, a Greens leader. “Nuclear power is not 100 percent safe, which makes it highly dangerous.” Professor Wolf said that German leaders once insisted that “we could trust our engineers, we could trust our technicians, and nuclear power was completely safe.” “This argument has been shattered by Fukushima,” he said. Germany’s suspicion of nuclear technology is not new, developing partly from the profound sense of pacifism that grew from World War II, and from decades of what Professor Wolf called “a potential nuclear battlefield” between East and West on the very front line of the cold war. Four decades ago, civil society groups chose as their slogan “Nuclear power? No thanks!” Then, a groundswell of opposition to America’s stationing of nuclear-armed missiles on German soil seemed to some to conflate two separate issues, nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, making for a combustible mix. Some, though, see the galvanizing moment as the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown in 1986. “That was a shock, and the shock was never overcome,” said Claudia Kemfert, an energy professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. “Chernobyl showed that it’s not a safe technology,” Professor Kemfert said in a telephone interview, and that spurred the Social Democrats and the Greens to start campaigns against nuclear technology that not only endured, but broadened. In Germany, Professor Kemfert said, political groups, civil society organizations and faith groups all oppose nuclear power. “These groups all oppose nuclear power,” she said. “This is different in other countries.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/europe/02germany.html","date":"Jun 2, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":383042046,"title":"Unclean Nuclear Energy","body":"To the Editor: The nuclear industry is bamboozling the Environmental Protection Agency into its agenda of promoting nuclear power as “clean” (“ E.P.A.

Why focus only on carbon emissions while ignoring iodine-129, plutonium-239, cesium-135 and other lethal radionuclides? The nuclear industry wants us to focus narrowly on the fission process and to ignore the footprint of mining, milling, enrichment, processing and storing of nuclear fuel.

Swedes voted nearly three decades ago to phase out nuclear power, and government officials said Thursday’s announcement marked a significant change. “It’s quite a big step for us,” Ola Altera, state secretary for enterprise and energy, said. “Everyone has moved their preferred positions to reach this compromise,” Mr. Altera added, who noted that his Center Party, had long been skeptical about any nuclear construction in Sweden. Under the Swedish plan, which still needs approval from Parliament, replacement reactors would gradually be built at the 10 sites where reactors are still operating. “There has been pressure from industry to expand the use of nuclear in Sweden, but that’s not the idea,” Mr. Altera said. Other parts of Europe, including Italy and Germany, have also signaled a renewed interest in nuclear as concerns grow over energy security and climate change, and as worries about safety risks diminish. Many restrictions on nuclear power in Europe were imposed after accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl, in the Soviet Union, in 1986. In Britain last year, the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown took a similar decision to Sweden’s to replace aging nuclear plants, a move that analysts said demonstrated a new era of pragmatism. The Labor government had previously branded nuclear power as an unattractive option. Both Britain and Sweden “have had to face a situation the electricity they generate from existing reactors would be extremely difficult to substitute with anything else but nuclear,” Luis Echávarri, director general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency, an organizationthat advises industrialized countries, said. Britain generates about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear, while Sweden still generates about 45 percent of its power from the technology. Using renewable sources to generate those same quantities of power would present huge technical and financial challenges, and might even be impossible, while using coal or less-polluting natural gas would make it much harder for either country to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Echávarri said. Sweden already generates about 45 percent of its electricity from hydro power, but public opinion has become more favorable toward nuclear power. Sweden is also aiming by mid-century to have no net emissions of greenhouse gases by using, in part, a combination of low-carbon nuclear power and renewable energies like wind- and hydro power. Even so, Mr. Altera, it could take until 2023 to open the first new reactor in Sweden because of the cost and risks involved. He mentioned the difficulties experienced by Areva, a French nuclear constructor that is building a new reactor at the site at Olkiluoto, Finland, where the project is behind schedule and vastly over budget. The experience “doesn’t make it obvious that there will be new reactors” in Sweden, Mr. Altera said.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/business/worldbusiness/06nuke.html","date":"Feb 6, 2009 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1149502985,"title":"Shutdown of Nuclear Plant Is Rejected by Maine Voters","body":"The beleaguered nuclear power industry won a victory in Maine yesterday, where voters rejected an effort to shut down the state\u0027s only nuclear power plant. The beleaguered nuclear power industry won a victory in Maine yesterday, where voters rejected an effort to shut down the state\u0027s only nuclear power plant. If the referendum had been approved, it would have been the first time voters in any state ordered the shutdown of an operating nuclear power plant. The vote capped a campaign that was closely watched by both supporters and opponents of nuclear power around the country. The Maine referendum was one of those attracting the most attention among dozens of referendums and amendments submitted to voters in various states in elections yesterday. Wagering Plan Wins in Texas In Texas, race track wagering, banned for the last 50 years, will return under a referendum approved by voters there. Supporters had argued that parimutuel gambling would spur the state\u0027s sagging economy. But critics, including many church leaders and law-enforcment officials, were opposed. Animal welfare groups joined in the opposition, citing mistreatment of greyhounds at dog tracks in other states. Virginia Lottery Approved Voters in Virginia approved a state lottery, a proposal that had been rejected repeatedly over the last decade by that state\u0027s legislature. Many voters told poll takers that they believed the lottery would prevent a tax increase. It was the prospect of greater state revenue that led law-enforcment officials and educators to endorse the measure. Church groups headed the opposition, joined by a number of prominent politicians, including Gov. Gerald L. Baliles and former Gov. Charles S. Robb. The Virginia Legislature has repeatedly rejected a lottery. But Governor Baliles, who did not declare his opposition until a week ago, urged that it be submitted to voters. In other proposals, Mississippi voters agreed to abolish a century-old constitutional prohibition against interracial marriage. In Pennsylvania, a $100 million bond issue was approved to acquire farmland in order to protect it from development. Voters in Baltimore narrowly defeated an amendment to the city charter that would have required the city to provide a residence for all its homeless. Ballot Issue in U.S. Capital In the District of Columbia, voters rejected a proposed bottle bill that would have required deposits on disposable containers. National beverage wholesalers spent nearly $2 million to defeat the measure, making this the most expensive political campaigns in the district\u0027s history. Ohio voters rejected a proposal to have the state\u0027s 65 top judges appointed by the governor, rather than elected, as is now the case. Ohio labor unions were among the leaders of the drive to preserve the \u0027\u0027sacred right\u0027\u0027 of citizens to vote for their judges. In Maine, supporters of the nuclear power plant, led by the consortium of 11 utilities that owns it, spent $5 million to advertise their case that the plant was the cheapest and safest source of power in the state. A shutdown, they argued, would force a 25 percent increase in rates to pay for alternative power. Opponents, with a budget of about $600,000, sought to tap both general fear of nuclear power, heightened by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, and specific concern that the continued operation of Maine Yankee might encourage the Federal Government to choose a site in Maine to dispose of high-level radioactive wastes, such as spent fuel from power plants. Even before the balloting, the plant\u0027s owners had vowed to fight in court against a shutdown, arguing that the Federal Government, through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, had sole power to rule on whether nuclear plants are safe to operate. Economics Issue Raised Opponents of the plant said they believed their resolution was worded to withstand such a challenge. It asked voters whether they wanted the plant to continue operating if it produced nuclear waste, which, of course, all nuclear plants do. They argued that waste disposal was an issue of economics, not just plant safety, and that states have jurisdiction over economic issues. When it was commissioned in 1972, the Maine Yankee plant was the largest nuclear power plant in the country, producing 840 megawatts of power. It has since been surpassed in size. But with the cost overruns of more recently built plants, it remains one of the cheapest sources of nuclear or even conventionally produced power, at about 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour wholesale. The plant, which is in Wiscasset, about 40 miles northeast of Portland, is licensed to operate until the year 2008. The referendum in Maine was being closely watched for a reading on sentiment toward nuclear power. The beleaguered nuclear power industry was pressing for a victory as part of its national advertising and public relations campaign to restore nuclear power as a credible energy source. At the same time, critics of nuclear power were looking to the Maine vote as an inspiration to opponents of nuclear power elsewhere in the country. Such critics are pushing referendum\u0027s against operating nuclear plants in Massachusetts, California and Oregon. With the help of state and local governments, opponents are also fighting the opening of the completed plants at Seabrook in New Hampshire and Shoreham on Long Island. \u0027\u0027It may spur others on,\u0027\u0027 Scott Denman, director of of Safe Energy Communication Council, said of the referendum fight in Maine. The council is an umbrella group of 13 environmental, consumer and safety groups opposed to nuclear power. #2 Earlier Votes in Maine Critics of nuclear power had twice before, in 1980 and 1982, placed a resolution on the Maine ballot seeking the shutdown of Maine Yankee. But the referendums were defeated in both cases.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9B0DE7D7123CF937A35752C1A961948260","date":"Nov 4, 1987 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1609622044,"title":"Panel Urges Germany to Close Nuclear Plants by 2021","body":"BERLIN — Germany should close all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 and rely entirely on other forms of energy, according to a committee appointed by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan. The recommendations, which have not been made public, will go to a panel of specialists meeting in a closed session in Berlin this weekend. Mrs. Merkel said this week that Germany would certainly end its reliance on nuclear energy, and that the only question was how long nuclear would be needed as a “bridge technology” until other forms of energy could meet the country’s needs. Nuclear energy provides 22.6 percent of Germany’s electricity, according to the Energy Ministry. Coal supplies more than 42 percent; natural gas, 13.6 percent; and renewable sources like wind and solar, 16.5 percent. Other sources provide the rest. Not even Japan, site of the nuclear disaster that followed an earthquake and tsunami in March, plans to abandon nuclear power. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday that Japan would scrap plans to build 14 more nuclear reactors while the government re-evaluated its energy policies. Nuclear energy provides 30 percent of Japan’s electricity. Germany’s move away from nuclear energy is being closely watched by environmental groups and other European governments, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe that plan to develop or expand nuclear power production. “At the moment, there is really a mixed picture in responding to the Japanese disaster by countries that have nuclear power,” said Serge Gas, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Agency, part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While Russia, Britain, France and Poland have said they will leave their nuclear energy policies largely unchanged, Italy and Switzerland have stopped development of new reactors. Germany, which has a strong antinuclear movement that cuts across the political spectrum, has gone the furthest in reacting to the Fukushima accident. According to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group, 440 nuclear reactors operate in 31 countries, producing about 15 percent of the world’s electricity. The association said more than 60 plants were being built in 15 countries, notably Russia, China and South Korea. Germany has 17 reactors; six are boiling water reactors, which is the design used at Fukushima, and 11 use pressurized water. The United States has 104 operating reactors, of which 35 are boiling water reactors and 69 are pressurized water. Big German energy companies, including RWE and E.ON, have warned that the rapid withdrawal of nuclear power could spell disaster for the economy, lead to electricity shortages and turn the country into a net importer of energy. But the so-called Ethics Commission appointed by Mrs. Merkel said that rather than being damaged by the abandonment of nuclear power, the German economy could benefit from the reduction of energy use and the development of alternative power sources. The commission is led by a conservative, Klaus Töpfer, a former environment minister and former executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, and Matthias Kleiner, president of the German Research Foundation. The 22 panel members were drawn from the energy industry and nongovernmental organizations. “A withdrawal from nuclear power will spur growth, offer enormous technical, economic and social opportunities to position Germany even further as an exporter of sustainable products and services,” said the panel’s 28-page report, which was seen by The International Herald Tribune. “Germany could show that a withdrawal from nuclear energy is the chance to create a high-powered economy.” But while citing the economic benefits of a withdrawal from nuclear power, the commission emphasized that Germany’s 17 nuclear plants should be closed for safety reasons. “The withdrawal is necessary to fundamentally eliminate risks,” it said. The commission also said it would be unacceptable for Germany to ration electricity, import power from nuclear plants in other countries or increase carbon dioxide emissions. “There is an ethical responsibility to combat climate change,” it said. The commission acknowledged that it was not possible to greatly accelerate the development of renewable energy. Instead, it recommended measures, including reducing energy use by as much as 60 percent and developing cleaner technologies for coal-fired power plants. Only last year, Mrs. Merkel overturned a decision by a previous Social Democratic-Green government to close Germany’s nuclear plants by 2022, instead allowing the newer reactors to operate well into the 2030s. She quickly changed her mind in March, as the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi plant became apparent. She ordered seven of Germany’s power plants to be temporarily closed, instituted a moratorium on construction of new reactors, ordered an intensive review of security and safety measures, and appointed the Ethics Commission. She announced the decision days before regional elections in southwestern Germany, where the Greens soundly defeated the governing conservatives.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/business/energy-environment/12energy.html","date":"May 11, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1406648907,"title":"Reversing Course, Japan Makes Push to Restart Dormant Nuclear Plants","body":"TOKYO — The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made its biggest push yet to revive Japan’s nuclear energy program on Tuesday, announcing details of a draft plan that designates atomic power as an important long-term electricity source. The new Basic Energy Plan, which states that Japan will push to restart reactors that were closed after the disaster in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, overturns a promise made by a previous government to phase out the country’s nuclear reactors. The plan also leaves open the possibility of building new plants as well as restarting existing ones. Japan’s minister for trade and industry, Toshimitsu Motegi, sought to play down the shift, telling reporters that Japan was still committed to “reducing its reliance on nuclear power.” But he also criticized the earlier commitment, first made by Prime Minister Naoto Kan in the months after the Fukushima disaster, to forgo nuclear power entirely, a policy Mr. Motegi called irresponsible for a resource-poor nation. Still, the government’s own energy plan was vague, setting no specific targets for the percentage of power to be provided by nuclear energy. Mr. Motegi said the country needed more time to figure out the best mix of energy sources, which would also include renewables like solar, wind and geothermal power. The Japanese have been struggling for three years to decide whether to return to nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, which contaminated a vast area of northeast Japan and is still keeping tens of thousands of people from their homes as a cleanup effort continues. Mr. Abe has been promising to add nuclear power back into Japan’s energy mix since soon after he took office in late 2012, but he has been unable to budge national opinion even as a renewed reliance on fossil fuels has increased energy costs and helped drive Japan’s trade deficit to record highs. Polls show lingering public misgivings about the safety of nuclear energy and the government’s ability to oversee it, with a majority of people supporting a gradual phaseout. The draft plan issued this week, the first under Mr. Abe, suggests that he plans to move forward despite a lack of agreement among citizens. To ease public jitters, an independent regulatory agency has been evaluating whether Japan’s 50 operable reactors, which are all currently idle, can safely be brought back online. Even with regulatory approval, though, local opposition could still block or delay restarts. The national plan did not say when the government would begin trying to restart reactors, which are being upgraded to meet the agency’s new safety requirements. The government is set to discuss the policy with opposition parties, but the cabinet can approve it at any time. Mr. Abe may feel empowered to move ahead in part because the country’s organized opposition to nuclear power — which erupted in the months after the Fukushima accident into mass street rallies — has failed to materialize. In a closely watched governor’s race in Tokyo this month, a fractured field of antinuclear candidates appeared to split the opposition vote, helping to return a pro-nuclear governing party candidate to office. That victory has given momentum to Mr. Abe’s push. Mr. Kan, the former prime minister who led the country’s response to the Fukushima crisis, blasted the turn back toward nuclear power. “This government has not learned the lessons of Fukushima,” he said in a telephone interview. “Japan was on the brink, but now we want to go back to nuclear for economic reasons. But what happens to the economy if another disaster hits?” Fears about nuclear safety were heightened on Tuesday by another mishap at the crippled Fukushima plant, where continued radiation leaks and errors have undermined cleanup efforts. The plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, said a damaged power cable had shut down a vital cooling system, forcing workers to suspend the delicate process of removing spent nuclear fuel rods from a wrecked storage pool. The cooling system for the pool at Reactor No. 4 failed for about four hours on Tuesday before power was restored, Tokyo Electric Power said in an emailed announcement. It added that the pool temperature was stable and that it had not detected a rise in radiation levels at the plant. The country’s new energy plan calls nuclear power an important “baseload” electricity source — one that can produce energy at a constant rate and at a lower cost than alternatives like solar or wind power. Proponents of renewable energy argue that safety risks and the costs of handling nuclear waste make nuclear power less reliable and more expensive than other options. The plan also says that Japan will ultimately determine the appropriate size of its nuclear program after taking into account its future energy needs, as well as its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which have surged with the decline of nuclear power. That wording, Japanese news outlets noted, left the door open for the government to build new plants.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/world/asia/japan-pushes-to-revive-moribund-nuclear-energy-sector.html","date":"Feb 25, 2014 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1472524731,"title":"E.U. Approves British Plan for Nuclear Power Plant","body":"LONDON — The European authorities on Wednesday approved construction of Britain’s first nuclear power station since the mid-1990s, in a ruling that could clear the way for other European countries to plan nuclear plants as part of their energy future. The decision, by the European Union’s competition regulator, removes one of the final obstacles for the plant, at Hinkley Point in southwest England, which would produce about 7 percent of Britain’s current power supply but would not start operating before 2023. Although the British government had already approved the power station, Brussels needed to sign off to make sure the financing plan did not constitute unfair state aid. The plant would be built by EDF Energy, the British subsidiary of the French state-controlled utility, which already operates nearly all the nuclear power plants in Britain. EDF said the plants would cost 16 billion pounds, or $25.7 billion, at 2012 prices. EDF has spent more than 1 billion pounds on design work and preparation for the site, which overlooks the Severn Estuary. Under the arrangement, government-guaranteed rates for the power eventually generated from the plant is guaranteed to give EDF a return on its investment. Policy makers and energy executives elsewhere are closely watching Hinkley Point as a test case of whether new nuclear plants can be built in the West given the high costs and the environmental risks. While valued by proponents as a cleaner-energy alternative to carbon-fueled power plants, the radioactive risks of nuclear power were vividly illustrated by the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011, an event that helped prompt Germany’s decision to abandon all future plans for nuclear power stations. The Hinkley Point project is running years behind schedule, with mounting costs. Centrica, a British utility, walked away last year from its 20 percent share in the project, citing frustration over delays and costs. To share in the costs, EDF has said it wants to bring in two Chinese state-backed companies, the China General Nuclear Corporation and the China National Nuclear Corporation, and, potentially, other investors. The British government is nonetheless pressing on with the project, as it worries about future sources of energy. Britain’s current nuclear plants, which generate around 20 percent of the country’s electricity, are approaching the ends of their lives. Meanwhile, the country’s North Sea oil and natural gas reserves are dwindling, and coal-fired plants are being retired to reduce carbon emissions. Britain’s determination to go ahead with a new nuclear power station at a large cost accentuates the divisions that are opening among European countries over nuclear power. The government wants to build not only Hinkley Point but also several more plants to replace its aging collection of nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, Germany is easing out of the nuclear power business, forcing utilities to rely more on highly polluting coal to generate the kind of steady flows of electricity that cannot yet be supplied by renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Despite the problems, other nuclear providers from around the world are eyeing Britain as a potential market. Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan have been studying British projects, while EDF is also contemplating building another plant on Britain’s east coast at Sizewell. But how many new plants will be built in Britain or other European countries now considering such a move — including Hungary, Lithuania and Poland — remains a big question. A few countries voted against the decision. That includes Austria, which opposes the use of nuclear power and is threatening to go to court to try to block Hinkley Point. Of the main European economies, only France has long remained committed to nuclear power. \"You will have a lot of discussion about how expensive these projects are,” said Roland Vetter, an analyst at CF Partners, an energy trading firm in London. “I don’t know how many more companies will want to build more nuclear plants in Britain.” The specter of future power outages and the pressures to meet climate change goals have pushed the British government to intervene once again in a power sector that was privatized decades ago. The government, which also built all of Britain’s nuclear plants in the past, is now getting actively involved in the energy business, offering generous subsidies not only for nuclear power but also for renewable energy installations like giant offshore wind farms and even projects using tidal power. Joaquín Almunia, the European official in charge of competition policy, who announced Wednesday’s decision, had been investigating since last year whether Hinkley Point violated European Union rules against state aid. Those subsidies would take two main forms. The government had proposed a guaranteed wholesale price of 92.50 pounds a megawatt hour for the electricity the new plant will generate. That is about double current electricity rates in Britain. In a second form of subsidy, the British government also agreed to provide financial guarantees for the projects estimated at 17 billion pounds in financing. Brussels’ state-aid concern would focus on whether Britain was giving unfair advantages to EDF over other industry players — or whether the government subsidies would distort energy markets.But Mr. Alumunia said his office had been persuaded by Britain’s argument that the Hinkley project could not proceed without the government’s subsidies and so had agreed not to oppose it after London agreed to some modest changes. Analysts say that there was tremendous pressure on the European regulators to approve the deal because two big players in the 28 nation group, Britain and France, were behind it and because the British government portrayed the power station as necessary to keep the lights on — not to mention creating around 25,000 jobs during the decade-long construction phase. “This is an important next step on the road to Britain’s first new nuclear power station in a generation,” Ed Davey, Britain’s energy and climate change minister, said in a statement on Wednesday. Although Mr. Almunia said that the Hinkley Point approval did not necessarily create a precedent, analysts say the go-ahead given to the project should encourage other operators interested in building new nuclear facilities in Britain as well as in other European countries to think that they, too, might be able to use government financial support. “Any other countries in the E.U. that want nuclear power will take heart from this decision,” said Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization. Mark Johnston, a senior adviser to the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels, said the opposition to the Hinkley Point decision by a number of countries, which appeared to include Austria, Denmark, Slovenia and Luxembourg, showed that skepticism about the project had different strands. “Austria is against nuclear power, full stop,” said Mr. Johnston. “But some of the others don’t like the idea that market disciplines are broken to fund nuclear construction, while others may worry that fewer emissions in Britain will just make coal cheaper for other parts of Europe like Poland, and do little to reduce greenhouse gases overall.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/business/international/eu-approves-plan-for-new-nuclear-power-station-in-britain.html","date":"Oct 8, 2014 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-996840628,"title":"2 Companies Abandon Reactor Deals In Britain","body":"LONDON — Britain’s plans for a new generation of nuclear reactors suffered a serious setback Thursday when two German energy companies decided to abandon a multibillion-dollar nuclear power project because of costs. RWE and E.On said they would not proceed with a £15 billion ($24 billion) joint venture called Horizon Nuclear Power to build nuclear power plants in Britain. The companies said that the economic crisis reduced the capital available for major projects and that Germany’s plan to phase out nuclear power had put additional financial pressure on the companies. The decision to pull out of Horizon, based in Gloucester, followed a strategic review, said the companies, which are now focusing on finding a new owner for Horizon. “For the right company Horizon remains an attractive project, but sadly, at this time, not for us,” Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.On UK, said in a statement. The British government had drawn up concrete plans for as many as 12 nuclear reactors at eight sites in an effort to guarantee the supply of electricity as it moves to comply with European Union emissions standards. Under European Union law, about 30 percent of the coal and oil-fired power plants in Britain need to close by 2015 and would have to be replaced. Horizon was on track to open its first nuclear station by 2020. Charles Hendry, Britain’s energy minister, said the withdrawal by the two German companies was “clearly very disappointing, but the partners have clearly explained that this decision was based on pressures elsewhere in their businesses and not on any doubts about the role of nuclear in U.K. energy future.” But finding a buyer for Horizon, which was set up in 2009, could be a challenge. Nuclear power projects have a longer planning and investment horizon than other energy projects. E.On said abandoning Horizon would allow it to focus its investments in Britain on projects that could deliver earlier benefits, “rather than the very long term and large investment new nuclear power calls for.” Smaller rivals may struggle to come up with the financing for such projects. Scottish and Southern Energy, the utility, pulled out of a nuclear power project in Britain last year, citing construction risks. What is more, other large energy companies, including the French utility EDF, already have their own nuclear projects in Britain. EDF has yet to make its final decision on its plan to build a new reactor in the southwest of Britain. The company’s decision could hinge on the outcome of the French presidential election in May. Antony Froggatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House in London, said the decision by the German utilities would at the very least “delay the government’s plans to pursue the construction of new nuclear plants but more likely it will result in a reduction of capacity.” Nuclear power currently provides about 15 percent of Britain’s electricity, he said. The Labour Party, in the opposition, said RWE and E.On’s decision not to proceed with the Horizon project was “disappointing.” “Nuclear power has a vital role to play as part of a more sustainable, balanced and low-carbon future energy mix, to make us less reliant on volatile fossil fuel prices, increase our energy security, and keep prices down for families,” said Caroline Flint, a Labour lawmaker with responsibility for the party’s energy policy. E.On, the largest German utility, said its profit fell 50 percent last year, partly because it had to close nuclear reactors. The disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan a year ago prompted Germany to order the closing of all nuclear plants in the country by 2022. Volker Beckers, chief executive of Npower, RWE’s British operation, said he was convinced that Horizon’s development projects represented excellent sites for new nuclear power stations and that “nuclear power has an important role to play in the U.K.’s future energy mix.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/business/global/Britains-Nuclear-Plans-Suffer-Setback.html","date":"Mar 29, 2012 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":751420332,"title":"California sues Tesla, saying the company permitted racial discrimination at its factory.","body":"President Emmanuel Macron of France speaking at a turbine factory on Thursday. “The time has come for a nuclear renaissance,” he said. President Emmanuel Macron announced a major buildup of France’s huge nuclear power program on Thursday, pledging to construct up to 14 new-generation reactors and a fleet of smaller nuclear plants as the country seeks to slash planet-warming emissions and cut its reliance on foreign energy. The announcement represented an about-face for Mr. Macron, who had previously pledged to reduce France’s reliance on nuclear power but has pivoted to burnishing an image as a pronuclear president battling climate change as he faces a tough re-election bid in April. “What our country needs is the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry,” Mr. Macron said at a nuclear turbine factory in the industrial city of Belfort in eastern France as throngs of workers and political officials gathered around. “The time has come for a nuclear renaissance,” he added. Mr. Macron’s move is seen as a pivotal moment in a growing debate over nuclear power in Europe. The divide has taken on new dimensions as leaders pledge to avert a climate catastrophe and grapple with an energy crisis that has sent prices for natural gas and electricity surging to record highs — in part because nuclear energy production has fallen. Mr. Macron has been leading a coalition of like-minded countries in backing nuclear energy to speed up the push to net-zero emissions and energy independence. That has opened a rift with a group of nations led by Germany, which is wary of nuclear proliferation and will close its last atomic power plants this year, following a 2011 policy set by former Chancellor Angela Merkel after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. The French plan is aimed at cementing the country’s position as Europe’s biggest atomic power producer and positioning Électricité de France, or EDF, the troubled state-backed operator, to compete more aggressively against Chinese and American companies in the growing global market for nuclear energy. With an estimated starting price of 50 billion euros ($57 billion), Mr. Macron’s blueprint consists of constructing six mammoth next-generation pressurized water reactors at existing nuclear sites around France starting in 2028, with an option to consider building up to eight more by 2050. Saying it had “fallen behind” in the nuclear energy race, Mr. Macron said France would also build a prototype small modular reactor — a new type of scaled-down nuclear power plant — by 2030, pitting the country against a growing number of others pushing out the technology. Environmental groups denounced the plan, saying that Mr. Macron had not consulted Parliament or French citizens, and that nuclear power, which doesn’t produce direct carbon emissions but generates long-term radioactive waste, was a nonstarter in the fight against climate change. “This is a crucial decision that would engage France for centuries in terms of the hazardous waste that nuclear facilities produce,” Nicolas Nace, the head of energy transition policy at Greenpeace France, said. “There has been no real democratic debate about this — just a candidate making opportunistic declarations,” he added. Climate change and the nuclear industry’s potential role in it have become a central issue in France’s coming presidential election. Most candidates, with the exception of France’s Greens party, have said nuclear power is needed to meet climate goals. The nuclear industry is a national priority in France, creating about 200,000 jobs directly and indirectly. France relies on an aging fleet of 56 nuclear reactors — the most after the United States, with 93 — to generate 70 percent of its electricity and to export energy to other countries. But France has fallen from dominance as EDF, which has grappled with a series of longstanding setbacks, faces a full-blown crisis just as Europe struggles with an energy crunch. The company warned this week that its nuclear energy output would slump to the lowest levels since the 1990s because of problems at some sites, sending European energy prices to fresh highs. The company has temporarily closed 10 reactors, down from 17 in December, for maintenance, including to fix cracks found in pipes at some plants. The energy shortfall has left France in the awkward position this winter of leaning more heavily on its coal-fired power stations, tapping coal-generated electricity from Germany and relying on natural gas imports as prices spike amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While Mr. Macron has sought to position himself as a European leader in transitioning to a carbon-free future, France’s wind and solar power capacity is not yet sufficient to make up for the shortfall in its nuclear energy output. On Thursday, Mr. Macron said France would ramp up those power sources by seeking to create at least 50 offshore wind farms and doubling France’s capacity of onshore wind power. France will also increase its solar power capacity tenfold, to generate over 100 gigawatts of power, by 2030, he said. “We need to massively develop renewable energies,” Mr. Macron said, “because it is the only way to meet our immediate electricity needs, since it takes 15 years to build a nuclear reactor.” Whether EDF can fulfill Mr. Macron’s orders remains to be seen. The debt-laden company has been grappling with corrosion problems at old nuclear reactors for years. It has also struggled to convince foreign buyers that it can deliver projects on time and within budget. The company’s pressurized reactors — the type that Mr. Macron called for in his speech — have faced severe delays and cost overruns. In France, a reactor in the northwestern town of Flamanville that was supposed to be completed in 2012 at a cost of €3 billion has faced setbacks and won’t open until at least 2023, with the bill ballooning to over €12 billion. Another EDF reactor, in Finland, was planned to open in 2009; it now won’t start full power production until June. The EDF-backed Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in China’s Guangdong Province faced what the company said were “performance issues” last year. Mr. Macron said the government would “assume its responsibilities” in securing EDF’s finances and its short- and medium-term financing capacity. France will provide the company with what is likely to be tens of billions in state aid — made possible in part after Mr. Macron lobbied Brussels to classify nuclear energy as a green investment. Mr. Macron’s decision to cast the renewal of France’s nuclear energy arsenal around the fight against climate change at the Belfort nuclear turbine factory was strategic. General Electric took over the plant from the French company Alstom in 2015 when Mr. Macron, then France’s economy minister, approved the sale, which his political opponents criticized. On Thursday, hours before Mr. Macron spoke at the plant, EDF closed a deal with the blessing of the Élysée Palace to buy back part of the operations from General Electric.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/10/business/inflation-stocks-economy-news","date":"Feb 10, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1155803280,"title":"Atomic Balm?","body":"?

France, however, has had a success story. \u0027\u0027Nuclear Power: In France It Works,\u0027\u0027 an \u0027\u0027NBC News Special\u0027\u0027 at 10 o\u0027clock tonight, judiciously examines what happened. It is a first-rate piece of television journalism. The program, produced by Reuven Frank, is not advocating nuclear energy; it is not taking a stand one way or the other. It wants us to consider: How has French nuclear power managed to produce the cheapest electricity in Europe, generating enough surplus to export $1 billion worth of electricity each year? In the United States, uncompleted nuclear plants lie rusting. France has 49 nuclear reactors in operation; 15 are under construction. France brings a new plant on line in six years - from the start of construction through operation - at a cost of $1 billion. The plants are run by the Government, and they are all uniformly designed. By contrast, some United States plants have taken 12 years to go on line, at costs up to $4 billion. These plants, as the NBC correspondent Steve Delaney says, are \u0027\u0027virtually custom built to different designs by different contractors.\u0027\u0027 Even so, the questions this raises may now all be moot. No new nuclear plant has been ordered in the United States since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. The program doesn\u0027t quite say so, but nuclear energy in the United States is almost a dead issue. * In France, however, it is a national cause. The political left and right are united. Extraneous matters do not intrude. In a recent newspaper interview, the head of the French nuclear monopoly, Rene Carle, said that \u0027\u0027any three people can get together to stop a nuclear plant\u0027\u0027 in the United States. France is different. \u0027\u0027There is a unique national consensus here,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Delaney reports. \u0027\u0027The French believe their survival depends on nuclear power. That\u0027s why in France it works.\u0027\u0027 Presumably, this is true. Coal mines in France are exhausted. The country is dependent on OPEC for oil. \u0027\u0027Only in France,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Delaney reports, \u0027\u0027did Chernobyl fail to ignite public outrage. There is no anti-nuclear party here and the issue no longer sparks political debate.\u0027\u0027 At the same time, the possibilities of debate are deflected. The French Government maintains a continuing public-relations campaign. NBC shows citizens in hard hats being led on tours of nuclear plants. In French schools, students study nuclear energy. The prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, founded by Napoleon - \u0027\u0027part West Point, part M.I.T.,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Delaney calls it - trains technicians to run the nuclear plants. Visually, some of the NBC report is static; it looks like an industrial promotion film. Given the subject, though, it\u0027s hard to imagine how it could look otherwise. Nuclear energy is a sober topic, often contentious, and it suffers from a bad press. \u0027\u0027Nuclear Power: In France It Works\u0027\u0027 - written by Mr. Delaney and directed by Peter Poor - is almost a corrective. It is a very balanced look. Thus, while chronicling a success story, it also worries about nuclear garbage. Waste material with low levels of radiation may be safely buried and forgotten. High-level waste cannot be forgotten; it may stay radioactive for 5,000 years. For this and other reasons, NBC says, France\u0027s West German neighbors worry. Nonetheless, France persists. The results are impressive; 76 percent of French electricity is now generated by nuclear power - the United States\u0027s figure is 16 percent - and France exports its technology to the world. There are reasons for this, and \u0027\u0027Nuclear Power: In France It Works\u0027\u0027 explains them. It is a solid piece of work.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9B0DE4DC1E38F932A25750C0A961948260","date":"Mar 11, 1987 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1848262769,"title":"Culture of Complicity Tied To Stricken Nuclear Plant","body":"TOKYO — Given the fierce insularity of Japan’s nuclear industry, it was perhaps fitting that an outsider exposed the most serious safety cover-up in the history of Japanese nuclear power. It took place at Fukushima Daiichi, the plant that Japan has been struggling to get under control since last month’s earthquake and tsunami. In 2000, Kei Sugaoka, a Japanese-American nuclear inspector who had done work for General Electric at Daiichi, told Japan’s main nuclear regulator about a cracked steam dryer that he believed was being concealed. If exposed, the revelations could have forced the operator, Tokyo Electric Power, to do what utilities least want to do: undertake costly repairs. What happened next was an example, critics have since said, of the collusive ties that bind the nation’s nuclear power companies, regulators and politicians. Despite a new law shielding whistle-blowers, the regulator, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, divulged Mr. Sugaoka’s identity to Tokyo Electric, effectively blackballing him from the industry. Instead of immediately deploying its own investigators to Daiichi, the agency instructed the company to inspect its own reactors. Regulators allowed the company to keep operating its reactors for the next two years even though, an investigation ultimately revealed, its executives had actually hidden other, far more serious problems, including cracks in the shrouds that cover reactor cores. Investigators may take months or years to decide to what extent safety problems or weak regulation contributed to the disaster at Daiichi, the worst of its kind since Chernobyl. But as troubles at the plant and fears over radiation continue to rattle the nation, the Japanese are increasingly raising the possibility that a culture of complicity made the plant especially vulnerable to the natural disaster that struck the country on March 11. Already, many Japanese and Western experts argue that inconsistent, nonexistent or unenforced regulations played a role in the accident — especially the low seawalls that failed to protect the plant against the tsunami and the decision to place backup diesel generators that power the reactors’ cooling system at ground level, which made them highly susceptible to flooding. A 10-year extension for the oldest of Daiichi’s reactors suggests that the regulatory system was allowed to remain lax by politicians, bureaucrats and industry executives single-mindedly focused on expanding nuclear power. Regulators approved the extension beyond the reactor’s 40-year statutory limit just weeks before the tsunami despite warnings about its safety and subsequent admissions by Tokyo Electric, often called Tepco, that it had failed to carry out proper inspections of critical equipment. The mild punishment meted out for past safety infractions has reinforced the belief that nuclear power’s main players are more interested in protecting their interests than increasing safety. In 2002, after Tepco’s cover-ups finally became public, its chairman and president resigned, only to be given advisory posts at the company. Other executives were demoted, but later took jobs at companies that do business with Tepco. Still others received tiny pay cuts for their role in the cover-up. And after a temporary shutdown and repairs at Daiichi, Tepco resumed operating the plant. In a telephone interview from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mr. Sugaoka said, “I support nuclear power, but I want to see complete transparency.” Revolving Door In Japan, the web of connections between the nuclear industry and government officials is now popularly referred to as the “nuclear power village.” The expression connotes the nontransparent, collusive interests that underlie the establishment’s push to increase nuclear power despite the discovery of active fault lines under plants, new projections about the size of tsunamis and a long history of cover-ups of safety problems. Just as in any Japanese village, the like-minded — nuclear industry officials, bureaucrats, politicians and scientists — have prospered by rewarding one another with construction projects, lucrative positions, and political, financial and regulatory support. The few openly skeptical of nuclear power’s safety become village outcasts, losing out on promotions and backing. Until recently, it had been considered political suicide to even discuss the need to reform an industry that appeared less concerned with safety than maximizing profits, said Kusuo Oshima, one of the few governing Democratic Party lawmakers who have long been critical of the nuclear industry. “Everyone considered that a taboo, so nobody wanted to touch it,” said Mr. Oshima, adding that he could speak freely because he was backed not by a nuclear-affiliated group, but by Rissho Kosei-Kai, one of Japan’s largest lay Buddhist movements. “It’s all about money,” he added. At Fukushima Daiichi and elsewhere, critics say that safety problems have stemmed from a common source: a watchdog that is a member of the nuclear power village. Though it is charged with oversight, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency is part of the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Industry, the bureaucracy charged with promoting the use of nuclear power. Over a long career, officials are often transferred repeatedly between oversight and promotion divisions, blurring the lines between supporting and policing the industry. Influential bureaucrats tend to side with the nuclear industry — and the promotion of it — because of a practice known as amakudari, or descent from heaven. Widely practiced in Japan’s main industries, amakudari allows senior bureaucrats, usually in their 50s, to land cushy jobs at the companies they once oversaw. According to data compiled by the Communist Party, one of the fiercest critics of the nuclear industry, generations of high-ranking officials from the ministry have landed senior positions at the country’s 10 utilities since Japan’s first nuclear plants were designed in the 1960s. In a pattern reflective of the clear hierarchy in Japan’s ministries and utilities, the ministry’s most senior officials went to work at Tepco, while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities. At Tepco, from 1959 to 2010, four former top-ranking ministry officials successively served as vice presidents at the company. When one retired from Tepco, his junior from the ministry took over what is known as the ministry’s “reserved seat” of vice president at the company. In the most recent case, a director general of the ministry’s Natural Resources and Energy Agency, Toru Ishida, left the ministry last year and joined Tepco early this year as an adviser. Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s government initially defended the appointment but reversed itself after the Communist Party publicized the extent of amakudari appointments since the 1960s. Mr. Ishida, who would have normally become vice president later this year, was forced to step down last week. Kazuhiro Hasegawa, a spokesman for Tepco, denied that it was an amakudari appointment, adding that the company simply hired the best people. The company declined to make an executive available for an interview about the company’s links with bureaucrats and politicians. Lower-ranking officials also end up at similar, though less lucrative, jobs at the countless companies affiliated with the power companies, as well as advisory bodies with close links to the ministry and utilities. “Because of this collusion, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ends up becoming a member of the community seeking profits from nuclear power,” said Hidekatsu Yoshii, a Communist Party lawmaker and nuclear engineer who has long followed the nuclear industry. Collusion flows the other way, too, in a lesser-known practice known as amaagari, or ascent to heaven. Because the regulatory panels meant to backstop the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency lack full-time technical experts, they depend largely on retired or active engineers from nuclear-industry-related companies. They are unlikely to criticize the companies that employ them. Even academics who challenge the industry may find themselves shunned. As Japan has begun looking into the problems surrounding collusion since March 11, the Japanese news media has highlighted the discrimination faced by academics who raised questions about the safety of nuclear power. In Japan, research into nuclear power is financed by the government or nuclear power-related companies. Unable to conduct research, skeptics, especially a group of six at Kyoto University, languished for decades as assistant professors. One, Hiroaki Koide, a nuclear reactor expert who has held a position equivalent to assistant professor for 37 years at Kyoto University, said he applied unsuccessfully for research funds when he was younger. “They’re not handed out to outsiders like me,” he said. In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the main regulatory agency for the nuclear power industry, can choose from a pool of engineers unaffiliated with a utility or manufacturer, including those who learned their trade in the Navy or at research institutes like Brookhaven or Oak Ridge. As a result, the N.R.C. does not rely on the industry itself to develop proposals and rules. In Japan, however, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency lacks the technical firepower to draw up comprehensive regulations and tends to turn to industry experts to provide that expertise. The agency “has the legal authority to regulate the utilities, but significantly lacks the technical capability to independently evaluate what they propose,” said Satoshi Sato, who has nearly 30 years’ experience working in the nuclear industry in the United States and Japan. “Naturally, the regulators tend to avoid any risk by proposing their own ideas.” Inspections are not rigorous, Mr. Sato said, because agency inspectors are not trained thoroughly, and safety standards are watered down to meet levels that the utilities can financially bear, he and others said. Dominion in Parliament The political establishment, one of the great beneficiaries of the nuclear power industry, has shown little interest in bolstering safety. In fact, critics say, lax oversight serves their interests. Costly renovations get in the way of building new plants, which create construction projects, jobs and generous subsidies to host communities. The Liberal Democrats, who governed Japan nearly without interruption from 1955 to 2009, have close ties to the management of nuclear-industry-related companies. The Democratic Party, which has governed since, is backed by labor unions, which, in Japan, tend to be close to management. “Both parties are captive to the power companies, and they follow what the power companies want to do,” said Taro Kono, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker with a reputation as a reformer. Under Japan’s electoral system, in which a significant percentage of legislators is chosen indirectly, parties reward institutional backers with seats in Parliament. In 1998, the Liberal Democrats selected Tokio Kano, a former vice president at Tepco, for one of these seats. Backed by Keidanren — Japan’s biggest business lobby, of which Tepco is one of the biggest members — Mr. Kano served two six-year terms in the upper house of Parliament until 2010. In a move that has raised eyebrows even in a world of cross-fertilizing interests, he has returned to Tepco as an adviser. While in office, Mr. Kano led a campaign to reshape the country’s energy policy by putting nuclear power at its center. He held leadership positions on energy committees that recommended policies long sought by the nuclear industry, like the use of a fuel called mixed oxide, or mox, in fast-breeder reactors. He also opposed the deregulation of the power industry. In 1999, Mr. Kano even complained in Parliament that nuclear power was portrayed unfairly in government-endorsed school textbooks. “Everything written about solar energy is positive, but only negative things are written about nuclear power,” he said, according to parliamentary records. Most important, in 2003, on the strength of Mr. Kano’s leadership, Japan adopted a national basic energy plan calling for the growth of nuclear energy as a way to achieve greater energy independence and to reduce Japan’s emission of greenhouses gases. The plan and subsequent versions mentioned only in broad terms the importance of safety at the nation’s nuclear plants despite the 2002 disclosure of cover-ups at Fukushima Daiichi and a 1999 accident at a plant northeast of Tokyo in which high levels of radiation were spewed into the air. Mr. Kano’s legislative activities drew criticism even from some members of his own party. “He rewrote everything in favor of the power companies,” Mr. Kono said. In an interview at a Tepco office here, accompanied by a company spokesman, Mr. Kano said he had served in Parliament out of “conviction.” “It’s disgusting to be thought of as a politician who was a company errand boy just because I was supported by a power company and the business community,” Mr. Kano said. Taking on a Leviathan So entrenched is the nuclear power village that it easily survived postwar Japan’s biggest political shake-up. When the Democratic Party came to power 20 months ago, it pledged to reform the nuclear industry and strengthen the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Hearings on reforming the agency were held starting in 2009 at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said Yosuke Kondo, a lawmaker of the governing Democratic Party who was the ministry’s deputy minister at the time. But they fizzled out, he said, after a new minister was appointed in September 2010. The new minister, Akihiro Ohata, was a former engineer at Hitachi’s nuclear division and one of the most influential advocates of nuclear power in the Democratic Party. He had successfully lobbied his party to change its official designation of nuclear power from a “transitional” to “main” source of energy. An aide to Mr. Ohata, who became Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in January, said he was unavailable for an interview. As moves to strengthen oversight were put on the back burner, the new government dusted off the energy plan designed by Mr. Kano, the Tepco adviser and former lawmaker. It added fresh details, including plans to build 14 new reactors by 2030 and raise the share of electricity generated by nuclear power and minor sources of clean energy to 70 percent from 34 percent. What is more, Japan would make the sale of nuclear reactors and technology the central component of a long-term export strategy to energy-hungry developing nations. A new company, the International Nuclear Energy Development of Japan, was created to do just that. Its shareholders were made up of the country’s nine main nuclear plant operators, three manufacturers of nuclear reactors and the government itself. The nuclear power village was going global with the new company. The government took a 10 percent stake. Tepco took the biggest, with 20 percent, and one of its top executives was named the company’s first president.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world/asia/27collusion.html","date":"Apr 26, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1662482052,"title":"Swiss Limit Nuclear Power","body":"Swiss citizens have voted to forbid the construction of nuclear power plants for the rest of the century but not to abandon nuclear power altogether.

Only 43 percent of those polled after the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan said they would approve building such new facilities in the United States to generate electricity. That is a steep decline from the 57 percent who said in 2008 that they approved of new plants. That poll was taken at a time of soaring gas prices and mounting concerns about global warming that led to calls for a new national energy policy and that drove popular support for nuclear power to its highest level in three decades. Support for nuclear power has waxed and waned over the decades, going up as the power-hungry nation looked for ways to meet demand and driven down by nuclear accidents at home and abroad. Support for more nuclear power plants was 69 percent in 1977, the highest level ever recorded in a poll by The New York Times or CBS News. But two years later, it plummeted to 46 percent after the Three Mile Island accident near Harrisburg, Pa. After the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1986, support dropped to 34 percent in a CBS News poll. The new poll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans think that nuclear power plants in the United States are generally safe. But nearly two-thirds of those polled said they were concerned that a major nuclear accident might occur in this country — including 3 in 10 who said they were “very concerned” by such a possibility. Fifty-eight percent of those polled said they did not think the federal government was adequately prepared to deal with a major nuclear accident. Still, 47 percent of those polled said that, over all, the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks; 38 percent said they did not. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted March 18-21 among 1,022 adults, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The unfolding crisis in Japan occurred just as many Americans believed that nuclear power was poised to make a comeback in the United States, more than three decades after the Three Mile Island accident. President Obama has spoken in his past two State of the Union addresses of the need to build more nuclear plants, and he has called for billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees for construction. Some environmental groups, and many members of Congress in both parties, have also increasingly come to consider nuclear power as a steady energy source that, since it does not emit carbon, could play an important role as the nation seeks to address concerns about climate change. But even before the Japan crisis, there were tremendous financial challenges for any new construction , and the number of plants that was expected to be built in the near future was small. Finding places to build new plants could also prove difficult: more than 6 in 10 of those polled said they would not approve of a nuclear plant in their community. Support was highest in the South, where plans are under way for new plants in South Carolina and Georgia , and in the Midwest. Attitudes toward nuclear power varied along partisan and gender lines, the poll found. A slim majority of Republicans said they approved of building more nuclear plants, while majorities of Democrats and independents disapproved. Republicans were also more likely to see the existing nuclear power plants as safe, and were more likely to say that the federal government was prepared to handle an accident, though most still said the government was not ready for such an emergency. And Republicans were less likely to disapprove of new nuclear plants in their areas: 50 percent of them said they did not want new nuclear plants nearby, compared with 69 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. There was also a gender divide: while a majority of men said they approved of new nuclear plants, most women disapproved. Women were also significantly less likely than men to say that the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks, more likely to say that they were “very” concerned about a major accident and more likely to say that the events in Japan made them more afraid that a nuclear accident could occur in the United States. Mr. Obama received high marks for his handling of the crisis from all political groups. Nearly half of those polled said they were concerned that radiation from Japan could harm people in the United States, with the results similar across all regions. But their concern did not run very deep: only 17 percent said they were “very concerned” about the possibility, including just 13 percent of those who live in the West.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/us/23poll.html","date":"Mar 23, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":521385412,"title":"The leader of Belarus, a staunch Kremlin ally, will travel to Iran.","body":"The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant seen from the city of Nikopol in October. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southern Ukraine briefly moved to emergency generators on Thursday after Russian shelling cut its external power supply, prompting the top director of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog to disparage the international community for failing to secure the complex. The nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe, and the only one to ever be in the middle of active fighting, has now been forced to resort to its emergency diesel generators six times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago, according to the U.N.’s top nuclear official, Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Each time, we are rolling a dice,” Mr. Grossi said on Thursday, “and if we allow this to continue time after time, then one day our luck will run out.” “I am astonished by the complacency,” added Mr. Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Later in the day, Ukraine’s national electric utility, Ukrenergo, said that the plant had been reconnected to the power grid after 11 hours. The European Atomic Energy Community — whose membership is composed of E.U. nations but which lies outside the authority of the European Parliament — and 49 countries made a joint appeal to the I.A.E.A., saying that Russia should leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, according to the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. “Nuclear terrorism and Russian blackmail must be stopped,” Mr. Shmyhal said on Twitter as he saluted the appeal. The dangers of being at the center of a war zone, including repeatedly moving to emergency power, pose a serious risk of nuclear catastrophe, experts say. Here’s a closer look at why. Image A satellite image showing the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia complex. Credit... Maxar Technologies, via Associated Press ‘Offline’ nuclear plants still need power. Even through all of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant have been shut down, the equipment that cools their nuclear cores and spent fuel rods needs a constant source of power. If the cooling is interrupted, the heat from the nuclear material could melt through its containment, spewing radiation. The site is running out of diesel fuel. It’s important that a nuclear plant remains connected to an external power source, either the power grid or a backup. The Zaporizhzhia plant’s emergency generators are powered by diesel fuel, but there is only so much on site. When the generators were activated after the shelling on Thursday, there was enough fuel to keep the generators going for 15 days, according to a statement from the I.A.E.A. And the plant is near a very active front line. “The concern is that it’s difficult to get diesel to that part of the battlefield to refill the generators to make sure the power stays on,” said Amy J. Nelson, the Rubenstein Fellow in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution and a nuclear security expert. During the previous periods when the plant was disconnected from external power, engineers raced to make repairs before the diesel fuel ran out. International nuclear inspectors have called the situation unsustainable and precarious. Image A Russian soldier outside the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in May. Credit... Associated Press The war presents other meltdown risks. Although the plant was designed to account for risks from natural disasters, plane crashes and the like, no nuclear facility has ever before been at the center of active fighting. Experts have a multitude of concerns. “It’s fire,” Ms. Nelson said. “It’s explosions from pressure building up.” She noted that fuel rods could become corroded and cause a nuclear accident. Any of these issues could disrupt power. Nuclear reactions produce heat that is channeled into steam to produce electricity, and any disturbance to the cooling process could cause a meltdown. Ms. Nelson referred to the events in Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake set off a tsunami that damaged the Fukushima nuclear complex, causing meltdowns. “The temperature in the reactor increased so much that the corrosion was accelerated and caused a leakage of fuel,” she said. If a power transformer is hit by shelling, that raises the risk of a fire. And cooling failures short of a meltdown could create pressure that might lead to an explosion.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/10/world/russia-ukraine-news/the-leader-of-belarus-a-staunch-kremlin-ally-will-travel-to-iran","date":"Mar 10, 2023 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1222562995,"title":"‘Safety Myth’ Left Japan Ripe for Nuclear Crisis","body":"SHIKA, Japan — Near a nuclear power plant facing the Sea of Japan, a series of exhibitions in a large public relations building here extols the virtues of the energy source with some help from “Alice in Wonderland.” “It’s terrible, just terrible,” the White Rabbit says in the first exhibit. “We’re running out of energy, Alice.” A Dodo robot figure, swiveling to address Alice and the visitors to the building, declares that there is an “ace” form of energy called nuclear power. It is clean, safe and renewable if you reprocess uranium and plutonium, the Dodo says. “Wow, you can even do that!” Alice says of nuclear power. “You could say that it’s optimal for resource-poor Japan!” Over several decades, Japan’s nuclear establishment has devoted vast resources to persuade the Japanese public of the safety and necessity of nuclear power. Plant operators built lavish, fantasy-filled public relations buildings that became tourist attractions. Bureaucrats spun elaborate advertising campaigns through a multitude of organizations established solely to advertise the safety of nuclear plants. Politicians pushed through the adoption of government-mandated school textbooks with friendly views of nuclear power. The result was the widespread adoption of the belief — called the “safety myth” — that Japan’s nuclear power plants were absolutely safe. Japan single-mindedly pursued nuclear power even as Western nations distanced themselves from it. The belief helps explains why in the only nation to have been attacked with atomic bombs, the Japanese acceptance of nuclear power was so strong that the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl barely registered. Even with the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the reaction against nuclear power has been much stronger in Europe and the United States than in Japan itself. As the Japanese continue to search for answers to the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, some are digging deep into the national psyche and examining a national propensity to embrace a belief now widely seen as irrational. Because of this widespread belief in Japanese plants’ absolute safety, plant operators and nuclear regulators failed to adopt proper safety measures and advances in technology, like emergency robots, experts and government officials acknowledge. “In Japan, we have something called the ‘safety myth,’ ” Banri Kaieda , who runs the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees the nuclear industry, said at a news conference at an International Atomic Energy Agency meeting in Vienna on Monday. “It’s a fact that there was an unreasonable overconfidence in the technology of Japan’s nuclear power generation.” As a result, he said, the nuclear industry’s “thinking about safety had a poor foundation.” Japan’s government has concentrated its propaganda and educational efforts on creating such national beliefs in the past, most notably during World War II. The push for nuclear power underpinned postwar Japan’s focus on economic growth and its dream of greater energy independence. But as the carefully fostered belief in nuclear safety has dissipated in the three months after the March 11 disaster, Japanese are increasingly blaming the nuclear establishment for Fukushima. In a politically apathetic country, tens of thousands have regularly held protests against nuclear power . Young Japanese have used social media to organize and publicize demonstrations that have been virtually ignored by major newspapers and television networks. A song, “It Was Always a Lie,” has become an anthem at the protests and a vehicle for Japanese anger on the Internet. Its author, a famous singer named Kazuyoshi Saito , wrote it by changing the lyrics of a love ballad, “I Always Liked You,” that he composed last year for a commercial for Shiseido, the cosmetics giant. Mr. Saito’s performance of the song, surreptitiously uploaded on YouTube and other sites, has gone viral. “If you walk across this country, you’ll find 54 nuclear reactors/School textbooks and commercials told us they were safe,” the song goes. “It was always a lie, it’s been exposed after all/It was really a lie that nuclear power is safe.” Caught Unprepared In the days after a giant tsunami knocked out Fukushima Daiichi’s cooling system, the prime minister’s office and the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, the plant’s operator, wrestled over whether to inject cooling seawater into the reactor buildings to prevent catastrophic meltdowns, and then over how to do it. With radiation levels too high for workers to approach the reactors, the Japanese authorities floundered. They sent police trucks mounted with water cannons — equipment designed to disperse rioters — to spray water into the reactor buildings. Military helicopters flew over the buildings, dropping water that was scattered off course by strong winds, in a “performance, a kind of circus” that was aimed more at reassuring an increasingly alarmed Japanese population and American government, said Kenichi Matsumoto, an aide to Prime Minister Naoto Kan. What became clear was that Japan lacked some of the basic hardware to respond to a nuclear crisis and, after initial resistance, had to look abroad for help. For a country proud of its technology, the low point occurred on March 31 when it had to use a 203-foot-long water pump — shipped from China, an export market for Japanese nuclear technology — to inject 90 tons of fresh water into the No. 1 reactor building. But perhaps more than anything else, the absence of one particular technology was deeply puzzling: emergency robots. Japan, after all, is the world’s leader in robotics. It has the world’s largest force of mechanized workers. Its humanoid robots can walk and run on two feet, sing and dance, and even play the violin. But where were the emergency robots at Fukushima? The answer is that the operators and nuclear regulators, believing that accidents would never occur, steadfastly opposed the introduction of what they regarded as unnecessary technology. “The plant operators said that robots, which would premise an accident, were not needed,” said Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, 77, an engineer and a former president of the University of Tokyo, Japan’s most prestigious academic institution. “Instead, introducing them would inspire fear, they said. That’s why they said that robots couldn’t be introduced.” Even before the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, Mr. Yoshikawa, a robotics expert, and other researchers began building emergency robots capable of responding to a nuclear accident, eventually producing a prototype called Mooty. The robots were resistant to high levels of radiation and capable of surmounting mounds of rubble. But the robots never made it into production, forcing Japan, in the aftermath of Fukushima, to rely on an emergency shipment of robots from iRobot , a company in Bedford, Mass., more famous for manufacturing the Roomba vacuum. On Friday, Tepco deployed the first Japanese-made robot, which was retrofitted recently to handle nuclear accidents, but workers had to retrieve it after it malfunctioned. The rejection of robots, Mr. Yoshikawa said, was part of the industry’s overall reluctance to improve maintenance and invest in new technologies. “That’s why the safety myth wasn’t just an empty slogan,” said Mr. Yoshikawa, now the director general of the Center for Research and Development Strategy at the Japan Science and Technology Agency. “It was a kind of mind-set that rejected progress through the introduction of new technology.” Entering a New Age The deliberate effort to rally Japanese behind nuclear power can be traced to the beginning of the atomic age, scholars and experts say. In August 1945, Yasuhiro Nakasone, a young naval officer who would become one of postwar Japan’s most powerful prime ministers, was stationed in western Japan. “I saw the nuclear mushroom cloud over Hiroshima,” Mr. Nakasone wrote in an essay in the 1960s. “At that moment, I sensed that the next age was the nuclear age.” For many Japanese like Mr. Nakasone, nuclear power became a holy grail — a way for Japan, whose lack of oil and other natural resources had led to World War II and defeat, to become more energy independent. The mastery of nuclear power would also open the possibility of eventually developing nuclear weapons, a subject that Japan secretly studied when Mr. Nakasone was defense minister in 1970. It was precisely because of nuclear power’s possible link to nuclear arms and its close ties to the United States that left-leaning politicians, academics and intellectuals became fierce opponents. As a countermeasure, proponents of nuclear power stressed its absolute safety, so that each side struck extreme positions, a standoff that lasts to this day. The nuclear establishment — led by Tepco among the utilities and the Ministry of Economy — spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and educational programs emphasizing the safety of nuclear plants. The ministry’s division responsible for nuclear power has budgeted $12 million this year for those programs, said Takanobu Sugimoto, a division spokesman. Mr. Sugimoto said he “regretted” that the ministry might have “stressed only” the plants’ safety. The government and the utilities encouraged the creation of many organizations that propagated the message of safety. One of the oldest, the Japan Atomic Energy Relations Organization , receives 40 percent of its financing from two ministries that oversee nuclear power and 60 percent from Japan’s plant operators. In addition to producing information promoting nuclear power, the organization sends nuclear power experts to speak at secondary schools and colleges, at no cost. Mitsuhiro Yokote, 67, the executive managing director of the organization and a former nuclear engineer at the Kansai Electric Power Company , acknowledged that the experts conveyed the message that nuclear plants were absolutely safe. Mr. Yokote said he “regretted” that his organization had contributed to the safety myth. In a country where people tend to reflexively trust the government, assurances about the safety of Japan’s plants were enough to reassure even those at greatest risk. In Oma, a fishing town in northern Japan where a plant is currently under construction , Chernobyl made no impression on local residents considering the plant back in the 1980s. 12 Photos View Slide Show › “What could we do but believe what the government told us?” said Masaru Takahashi, 67, a member of a fishing union in Oma. “We were told that they were absolutely safe.” A Public Relations Drive After Chernobyl, the nuclear establishment made sure that Japanese kept believing in safety. The plant operators built or renovated the public relations buildings — called “P.R. buildings” — attached to their plants. Before Chernobyl, the buildings were simple facilities intended to appeal to “adult men interested in technical matters,” said Noriya Sumihara , an anthropologist at Tenri University who has researched the facilities. Male guides wearing industrial uniforms took visitors around exhibits consisting mostly of wall panels. But after Chernobyl, the facilities were transformed into elaborate theme parks geared toward young mothers, the group that research showed was most worried about nuclear plants and radiation, Mr. Sumihara said. Women of childbearing age, whose presence alone was meant to reassure the visitors, were hired as guides. In Higashidori, a town in northern Japan, one of the country’s newest P.R. buildings is built on the theme of Tonttu, a forest with resident dwarfs. The buildings also holds events with anime characters to attract children and young parents, said Yoshiki Oikawa, a spokesman for the Tohoku Electric Power Company , which manages the site with Tepco. Here in Shika, more than 100,000 guests last year visited the P.R. building where Alice discovers the wonders of nuclear power. The Caterpillar reassures Alice about radiation and the Cheshire Cat helps her learn about the energy source. Instead of going down a rabbit hole, Alice shrinks after eating a candy and enters a 1:25 scale model of the Shika nuclear plant nearby. Since the Fukushima disaster, visitors have started questioning the safety of nuclear power, said Asuka Honda, 27, a guide here. Many were pregnant women worried about the effects of radiation on their unborn children. But the presence of Ms. Honda and other guides, mostly women in their late 20s, seemed to reassure them. The nuclear establishment also made sure that government-mandated school textbooks underemphasized information that could cast doubt on the safety of nuclear power. In Parliament, the campaign was led by Tokio Kano , a Tepco vice president who became a lawmaker in 1998. Mr. Kano, who declined to be interviewed for this article, returned to Tepco as an adviser after retiring from Parliament last year. In 2004, under the influence of Mr. Kano and other proponents of nuclear power, education officials ordered revisions to textbooks before endorsing them. In one junior high school social studies textbook, a reference to the growing antinuclear movement in Europe was deleted. In another, a reference to Chernobyl was relegated to a footnote. The effect could be seen in opinion polls that even after Fukushima have indicated that young Japanese are the strongest proponents of nuclear power. The nuclear establishment itself came to believe its own safety myth and “became entangled in its own net,” said Hitoshi Yoshioka , an author of a book on the history of Japan’s nuclear power and a member of a panel established by the prime minister to investigate the causes of the Fukushima disaster. He said that helped explain why, at Fukushima, Tepco failed to carry out emergency measures in case of a complete loss of power, which is what happened when the tsunami hit in March. Others have said that the nuclear establishment’s embrace of the safety myth also makes it possible to understand what, in hindsight, was the most glaring hole in the safety measures at Japan’s nuclear plants. In the country that gave the world the word tsunami, few measures were taken at Fukushima Daiichi or elsewhere to protect plants against the giant waves.

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Ukrainian officials were still working on Friday to fully restore operations at the country’s nuclear power plants, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. It has four sprawling nuclear plant complexes across the country that host 15 reactors. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants that remain under Ukraine’s control and required a halt to production. Reactors at the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plants were slowly being restarted and will be reconnected to the grid when the power systems are ready, Petro Kotin, the head of the Ukrainian national energy company, Energoatom, said on Thursday. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said. For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who remained without power Thursday evening. Officials said electricity had been restored to meet about half of the country’s consumption needs as of 7 p.m. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. A significant number of thermal and hydroelectric plants were back in operation but restarting nuclear plants takes more time, Ukrenergo, the national electric utility, said in its Telegram channel. Authorities were also prioritizing restoring energy to critical infrastructure — gas distribution, sewage treatment, and hospitals — before household consumers, the utility said. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/25/world/russia-ukraine-war-news/russias-strikes-triggered-emergency-protection-at-nuclear-plants-under-ukraines-control","date":"Nov 25, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1933722000,"title":"Security at Nuclear Power Plants Is Inadequate","body":"To the Editor: \"Gate Crasher Shakes Up Nuclear Debate,\" your Feb. 11 news article on the breach of security at the Three Mile Island nuclear power station, raises some serious questions about the security and regulation of nuclear power plants in the United States.

Yet a recently released mental patient, armed with little more than a Plymouth station wagon, was able to enter the \"protected area\" of a nuclear power plant and elude capture for four hours. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission acknowledges that plant operators at Three Mile Island did not know the number of intruders, where they were or whether they were armed. It would appear that security at Three Mile Island failed to protect the nuclear power plant. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission claims that it is not clear any regulations had been violated. If indeed the regulations were not violated, then perhaps it is time to rewrite them so that they require adequate protection of nuclear power plants. Unfortunately, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed in the opposite direction. Responding to industry pressure and to the deregulatory agenda of the Bush-Quayle Administration, the commission has embarked on an effort to relax a number of rules and regulations, including those supposed to protect against security breaches like the one at Three Mile Island.

The agreement, which comes with caveats, opens the way for China’s fast-growing nuclear industry to play a significant role in Britain’s plans to proceed with construction of its first new reactor in nearly two decades. George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, made the announcement on Thursday while visiting a nuclear power station in southern China. The project fits into Britain’s overall plan to deliver at least 12 new nuclear reactors at five sites by 2030. It contradicts countries like Germany and Japan that have pulled back from nuclear power since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. Britain has nine aging nuclear plants. Under an agreement signed by the two countries, British companies like Rolls-Royce and International Nuclear Services could also win a bigger role in China’s nuclear power expansion, according to an e-mail from the British Embassy in Beijing that summarized Mr. Osborne’s statement. China is already moving ahead with its own ambitious plan to build dozens of domestic nuclear power stations in coming years. China has 17 reactors now. After an earthquake and tsunami led to partial meltdowns of three nuclear reactors in Fukushima, China imposed a moratorium on construction for many months. The pace of construction has not fully recovered, and China has since reduced its target for nuclear power capacity in 2015 to 40 gigawatts, from 50. China’s interest in the British nuclear industry signals a break from a mostly domestic focus. While China has engaged in extensive cooperation with Pakistan in nuclear power, its industry has mostly concentrated on an enormous building program at home. Mr. Osborne’s announcement incited a debate over which type of strategic assets European countries should open to investment from China. “Cooperation on civil nuclear energy with China has been going on for a long time, and there are many French companies working with the Chinese on these issues, so it’s not something I find difficult to accept,” said Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for the internal markets, speaking in London. But, Mr. Barnier, added, “The only point I would make is that it is in Europe’s general interest that Europeans reflect on what are their strategic assets. Each country has its own vision of what is strategically important and I think it would be useful to have more of a common vision or strategy on this question.” Britain’s energy market is already dominated by European giants, including E.D.F., the French state-controlled power company that is supposed to oversee construction and eventually operate the proposed Hinkley Point project in southwest England, and the German utility E.On. Opening its nuclear power industry to Chinese investment raises questions over Beijing’s influence in a highly sensitive energy sector. The British government said that any Chinese investments had to meet strict standards for safety and security. Chinese investors will most likely have a minority stake in the Hinkley Point project, the government indicated Thursday, adding that “Over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.” Antony Froggatt, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, a research institute in London, said there were few concerns with a Chinese role because of the partnership with the French in China. “If there were a falling-out politically, I think they would be more likely to withdraw funding than to switch off the lights,” he said. While Germany wants to shut all of its nuclear plants by 2022 and shift almost entirely to wind and solar power by 2050, Britain is betting big on nuclear power. Though it is also pushing into production of shale oil and gas, Britain aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by the mid-2020s in large part by renewing the older nuclear power plants. But Britain’s ability to succeed with China’s help is anything but assured. Details of the planned Hinkley Point project in Somerset, including energy price guarantees offered by the British government that could result in higher power bills for consumers, are expected to be announced early next week. Britain says that there are no direct state subsidies for the project, which is now estimated to cost about $22 billion. Europe’s regulators who police state subsidies could dispute that figure. If and when the new plant, Hinkley Point C, comes fully online, it will supply about 7 percent of Britain’s electricity. That would be enough power for five million homes, with the added benefit of no carbon emissions. But the negotiations over the Hinkley Point plant have been long and difficult. Originally, E.D.F., which already operates 15 nuclear plants in Britain, had intended to be in partnership with Centrica, the owner of British Gas. But Centrica withdrew from discussions, saying the economic case for a partnership was not strong enough. That setback underscores how building a new nuclear plant in the West is expensive and fraught with risk. Two French-designed plants under construction at Flamanville, France, and Olkiluoto, Finland, have been plagued by technical problems and huge cost overruns. Last year, two big German utilities, R.W.E. and E.On, decided not to proceed with construction of a plant that had been planned for Wales, largely because of the costs and the uncertainty of getting a return on their investment. E.D.F.\u0027s stock price, along with those of many European utilities, has been under pressure of late. Kirsty Alexander, head of communications for the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade association for Britain’s nuclear industry, said E.D.F. was bringing on partners because “it’s the huge upfront capital investment. It’s billions and billions of pounds. With nuclear you don’t see any return on your investment for 15 years.” A possible investor is China General Nuclear Power, which is the majority stakeholder in the Taishan nuclear plant in Guangdong Province in southern China, where Mr. Osborne made his announcement on Thursday. China passed the United States in overall generating capacity in 2011 and now has a total of 1,145 gigawatts, compared with a little more than 1,000 gigawatts in the United States. Nuclear power represents 1.1 percent of China’s electricity generating capacity, compared with nearly 10 percent in the United States. In terms of electricity actually generated, as opposed to capacity, nuclear is about 2 percent of the total in China and 19 percent in the United States.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/business/international/britain-to-let-chinese-buy-into-nuclear-power-plants.html","date":"Oct 17, 2013 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-601966269,"title":"Opposition to Nuclear Power Grows Stronger","body":"To the Editor: To the Editor: Nuclear power may not be inherently unworkable, but it is being rejected worldwide for precisely those reasons you mention in \u0027\u0027Revive the Atom\u0027\u0027 (editorial, Dec. 8): bad economics, poorer safety and a lack of trust by the public. You imply that the antinuclear movement is a United States phenomenon, but nuclear power has never faced such determined opposition around the world. In Western Europe, France remains the only country with an active nuclear construction program, but France plans to order only one new plant in the next four years. The country has also seen an upswing in demonstrations - from across the political spectrum - against nuclear plants and waste dumps. Britain\u0027s hopes for a new line of plants, based on the Sizewell-B P.W.R. reactor, have collapsed. This followed government attempts to get a resistant financial community to swallow the uneconomic nuclear stations. Elsewhere in Europe, the talk is of wastes and decommissioning, not construction of new plants. Glasnost in the Soviet Union has been harsh on nuclear power advocates, with at least 10 plants closed or canceled in the last two years. This month, Hungary canceled plans to build four Soviet-style nuclear plants. Faced with the largest popular movement since World War II, Japanese industry and government are scaling back ambitious nuclear expansion plans. Taiwan saw its third attempt to construct more plants stopped by domestic opposition this year. South Korea saw its first anti nuclear demonstration a year ago; now the government faces a coalition that has succeeded in halting planned expansion and is calling for shutdowns. The notion that there are new environmentally benign and safe designs of nuclear plants that will alter public opposition is misconceived and not even shared by some in the industry.

Since then, safety requirements, which increased after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, have kept the industry from expanding.

The Bush energy plan could give a substantial boost to the industry. It declares the technology much safer than it was 20 years ago. It says the administration should encourage the relicensing of nuclear plants, which would not require Congressional action, and should seek legislation to reduce taxes that it says impede mergers of nuclear utilities.

In the months before his election, President Moon Jae-in had vowed not to allow any new reactors. When he made that pledge, five nuclear power plants were under construction, three of them near completion. Mr. Moon said that he would scrap the other two, which were both in the early stages. Since Mr. Moon took office in May, however, the fate of those two reactors has become the center of a raging debate over nuclear power in South Korea , and antinuclear groups were quick to condemn the decision on Friday. Opponents of nuclear power, who have gained momentum in South Korea since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011 and supported Mr. Moon during his campaign, wanted him to block the two reactors. But conservative media outlets and politicians, as well as the nuclear industry itself, have been just as vocal, insisting that nuclear remained a cheap, clean and reliable source of energy for South Korea, which produces neither crude oil nor natural gas. In June, Mr. Moon proposed an independent panel to study public opinion on the issue and make a recommendation. The panel worked with 471 citizens from various walks of life and conducted extensive surveys. While the panel was at work, Mr. Moon suspended the construction of the two reactors, both inside the Gori nuclear power complex in Ulsan, in the southeast of South Korea. On Friday, after three months of study, the panel endorsed a return to construction. Three-fifths of the panel supported the projects, while the remaining members were opposed. Mr. Moon’s office said it would honor the recommendation. Some villagers opposed to nuclear power who had gathered in front of a government building on Friday cried when they heard the panel’s decision. Civic groups campaigning against nuclear energy later said they respected its recommendation. But they lamented the influence of pronuclear groups who have carried out extensive publicity campaigns in recent weeks, promoting the benefits of nuclear power and warning that a phaseout could damage the economy. “After 40 years of nuclear power, special interest groups connected to the nuclear power industry have taken root everywhere in South Korean society, blinding the eyes of the people,” the Korean Federation for Environmental Movements said in a statement. The panel’s advice appeared to give Mr. Moon political cover on a highly divisive issue, saving him from having to order the costly abandonment of the effort. The government-controlled Korea Hydro \u0026 Nuclear Power Company, the country’s sole nuclear operator, has already spent $1.4 billion on the construction of the last two reactors. But the panel supported Mr. Moon’s long-term policy of weaning South Korea off nuclear energy, with 53 percent urging that nuclear power be scaled back, while nearly 10 percent wanted it expanded. More than a third favored maintaining current levels. South Korea is the world’s fifth-largest nuclear energy producer, with 24 reactors providing one-third of its electricity needs. The panel “recommends that the government make energy policy decisions in a direction of scaling down nuclear power generation,” said its chairman, Kim Ji-hyung, during a nationally televised news conference on Friday. Besides the five plants under construction, South Korea had planned to build six more. Mr. Moon has scrapped those plans. His government has also vowed not to extend the operation of existing reactors when they reach their life expectancy. In June, South Korea retired its oldest nuclear plant, Gori Reactor No. 1, which went into operation in 1978. Ten others will reach the end of their design life by 2030. Mr. Moon’s conservative predecessors championed nuclear power as a cheap energy source that they said helped drive the country’s export-dependent manufacturing sector and kept consumer electricity bills low. They had also hoped to develop nuclear into an export industry in its own right. South Korea is building four reactors for the United Arab Emirates under a $20 billion contract. But Mr. Moon has promised to invest more in renewable energy sources. He also said he would issue no new licenses for coal power plants. Skepticism over nuclear energy has grown in South Korea in recent years. Not long after the Fukushima disaster, South Koreans learned that nuclear plants across their country included parts whose safety test results had been faked . The country is also running out of space for high-level radioactive wastes, but no town has been willing to host a central depository. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake near some of the plants last year also raised concerns.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-plants.html","date":"Oct 20, 2017 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1388558970,"title":"Think Nuclear Power As Warming Solution","body":"To the Editor: Re \u0027\u0027Meeting Reaches Accord to Reduce Greenhouse Gases\u0027\u0027 (front page, Dec. 11): In discussions about global warming and measures to mitigate its consequences, nuclear power is often overlooked.

The nuclear plans, which are still in the early stages, are part of an ambitious proposal by Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, to triple its electricity output by 2025 while weaning itself off imported oil and onto local coal, gas, and renewable and atomic energy. A 2006 decree by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono calls for 5 percent of electricity to come from nuclear and other “new energy and renewable energy” sources by then. Proposals to build plants have been floated despite years of protests by environmentalists and community activists who argue that Indonesia, an archipelago that largely sits on a number of major fault lines, is too unstable to safely support nuclear power. As images from Japan’s disaster dredge up memories of the 2004 Asian tsunami — in which nearly 170,000 Indonesians died — these concerns have only grown. “Nuclear power plants are inherently dangerous. And if we build them in a country as prone to disasters as Indonesia, located on the Ring of Fire, the Pacific Rim, we’re creating the potential for a tremendous disaster,” said Arif Fiyanto, a climate and energy campaigner for Southeast Asia at the environmental group Greenpeace. “Indonesia has probably worse disaster characteristics than Japan,” Mr. Fiyanto said. “Japan has an excellent safety culture and an excellent early warning system. For the time being, Indonesia — we have to be honest — has been left far behind when it comes to this.” Deeply entrenched corruption and a culture of corner-cutting on other large projects are additional causes for concern, he said. The most prominent project is a proposal to build two plants with a combined capacity of 18,000 megawatts by 2022 in the provincial government of Bangka-Belitung, between the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The government is seeking bids for a feasibility study at the site. Supporters say both sites are far from Indonesia’s most active fault lines. Other sites have been suggested on the densely populated island of Java, as well as Madura, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Adiwardojo, the head of nuclear energy development at Indonesia’s National Nuclear Energy Agency, said that concerns about a disaster like that of Japan’s were misplaced because any plants Indonesia would use would have technology far more advanced than that of the four-decade-old reactors at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Indonesia is carrying out its assessment of potential nuclear sites using standards and guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mr. Adiwardojo said. “The important thing isn’t that Indonesia is on the Ring of Fire or there are tsunamis, so we can’t build,” he said. “No, the important thing is that we fulfill the requirements.” Until the recent crisis, a number of governments in Southeast Asia — which, with the exception of one inactive plant in the Philippines, has no nuclear power — had been seriously reconsidering nuclear power to cope with growing populations and rising affluence. Events in Japan, however, have led the government of Thailand to announce a freeze on developing the country’s first nuclear power plants, while the Philippines has discarded plans to activate the shelved Bataan reactor. In Malaysia, the government has said it has not yet decided whether to proceed with its nuclear power plans. But in Vietnam, plans to build a series of reactors, the first of which is projected to go online by 2020, have not been disrupted. In China, meanwhile, the government announced on Wednesday that it was suspending approvals of new nuclear power plants and stepping up inspections at its existing plants. In Indonesia, the move toward nuclear power has hardly been relentless. The country looks almost certain to miss a target set by Parliament to have nuclear power online between 2015 and 2019. Another flagship proposal to build a plant on Java’s coastal Muria Peninsula, at the foot of a dormant volcano, has also lost steam in the face of local opposition — although Mr. Adiwardojo says it is still part of the government’s plans. Within the presidential advisory body tasked with planning Indonesia’s power development, the National Energy Council, opinions are split. Herman Darnel Ibrahim, a council member, said nuclear power needed to be studied more but was unfeasible in areas where strong community objection persisted. “To make the people happy, that’s the bottom line of development,” he said. “If we build something and the people are not happy with it, they are worried, then maybe that development is meaningless,” Mr. Ibrahim said. But for the majority of those drafting Indonesia’s energy future, nuclear power remains a necessity. “We have to consider our energy supply in the long term,” said Herman Agustiawan, another council member. “Our population is 240 million. We have no choice.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/business/global/18atomic.html","date":"Mar 18, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1941378557,"title":"WESTCHESTER OPINION; NUCLEAR NAVY A FACTOR IN SHAPING U.S. FACILITIES","body":"IN the hundreds of articles that have recently been published about the differences between the nuclear electric-power programs in the United States and the Soviet Union, one major factor has been overlooked - an institution that has shaped its philosophy of operation for the last 30 years. That factor is the nuclear Navy. Its tradition of routine excellence in operation, established and rigidly enforced by Admiral Hyman Rickover, infused our nuclear-power program from the outset, as Navy veterans moved to the industry. The Navy\u0027s influence has increased further in recent years, as the industry has responded to the lessons learned from Three Mile Island. Everyone who serves in the nuclear Navy develops a deep and lasting respect for radiation and nuclear energy. I spent 16 years on nuclear submarines, living and working in extremely close quarters with about 100 other men - and with a nuclear power plant. We did not have the protection of the massive concrete-and-steel containment buildings that surround commercial nuclear power plants in the United States - which represent one of the key differences with the Chernobyl nuclear plant. In our case the containment was the hull of the submarine, and we were inside. When you work, eat, sleep and live under the ocean with a nuclear reactor, you quickly learn what \u0027\u0027shipshape\u0027\u0027 means. The slightest mistake can seriously complicate the work of the crew in the tight workspace of a submarine. A mistake that involves radiation could also endanger the health of your fellow crew members. Even worse, we often thought, the slightest mistake meant that we would have to explain it to the Admiral. After years of commanding submarines and training nuclear engineers, the Navy\u0027s cautious, \u0027\u0027safety-first\u0027\u0027 attitude had become deeply ingrained. Like other Navy veterans, I felt it was extremely important to apply the same approach in industry. I joined the New York Power Authority as first resident manager of the Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in 1976. From my first meeting with the Trustees of the Power Authority, it was clear that their No. 1 priority in the operation of Indian Point 3 would always be safety. This philosophy gave me the opportunity to emphasize two of the most important lessons from my Navy years: plant cleanliness and personnel training. Keeping a nuclear power plant clean is essential. A sloppy plant, with equipment in disarray or \u0027\u0027hot spots\u0027\u0027 of radiation would represent not only a potential health hazard to employees, but also an unnecessary level of expense, because internal operations would take more time. We have prided ourselves on its cleanliness. That has paid off in the form of an excellent record of occupational safety for the workers. Probably because I had served as commanding officer of the Navy Nuclear Power School in Bainbridge, Md. I was also a firm believer in high-quality training programs. I was happy to learn that Indian Point had been one of the first nuclear-power locations in the country that had a control-room simulator on-site for the training of reactor operators. It was installed by Con Edison. We are now building a second simulator, which will increase the time available for training. The Navy-style quality of operation has become even more evident since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. That mishap may have proved that reactor safety systems do, indeed, protect the public, especially the special containment buildings that surround nuclear plants. But it also taught the industry that very expensive accidents can occur if we get too casual about nuclear power operation. With an essentially spotless record stretching over two decades, some in the nuclear power industry in 1979 might have been taking safety too much for granted. I know that when I heard about the Three Mile Island accident, my initial reaction was disbelief. Later, the reactions of many in the industry changed to determination - determination to achieve the level of excellence that it knew was necessary. Since, Three Mile Island, the nuclear-power industry has changed significantly. The industry established a new Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, which is closely monitoring the operations of all commercial nuclear power plants in the United States and advising on how they can achieve a greater level of excellence. Its staff, with many Navy nuclear-service veterans included, adopted the stringent Navy traditions for safety and training. An even newer National Academy of Nuclear Training is assuring that virtually everyone who works at a nuclear plant -operators, supervisors, technicians - is thoroughly trained, tested and regularly re-accredited. These new efforts are having results. In nearly every performance category monitored by the institute, the industry has shown improvement year after year, indicating progress in both safety and the economic performance of the plants. At Indian Point 3, we have been fully participating in these industrywide programs and making our own constant improvements. Since January 1984 the plant has been available to generate electricity 83 percent of the time - including the time that it was out of service for scheduled refueling and maintenance. In the last review we received from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Indian Point 3 was rated in Category I, representing the top level of performance, in six of the 10 activities evaluated, and in the second category for the other four. It seems clear that United States nuclear power plants are now operating with a higher degree of excellence in safety and overall performance than ever before. Three Mile Island may have reminded us of the need for that excellence. But I like to think that much of the training and philosophical dedication to achieving it stemmed from the nuclear Navy.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/nyregion/westchester-opinion-nuclear-navy-a-factor-in-shaping-us-facilities.html","date":"May 25, 1986 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1624254972,"title":"Rudy Would Go Nuclear","body":"Just like Brazil is ahead of us in ethanol, France is ahead of us in nuclear power.

First, look at what \u0027\u0027state control\u0027\u0027 over the French nuclear power program means: heavy, taxpayer-funded subsidies for the nuclear power industry, which grossly distort the real costs of nuclear-generated electricity, and total Federal pre-emptive authority over all local and state bodies for licensing, site selection and construction of nuclear reactors. Furthermore, there is no requirement that nuclear plants be economically or environmentally preferable to alternative energy sources. Continued construction of nuclear reactors in France has led to substantial electricity surpluses, which create a need for further electrification in home, office and industry.

He emphasized the company’s commitment to the rapidly growing renewable energy sector. He said the decision was also “an answer” to political and social opposition to nuclear power in Germany. Siemens, which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear power plants, is the first big company to announce such a shift in strategy. But other German companies involved in the nuclear energy industry are also reconsidering their options. In May, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the accident at the nuclear power station in Fukushima, Japan, had convinced her that Germany should look to other power sources. The decision represented a turnaround for Mrs. Merkel, who a year ago agreed to prolong the life of the country’s nuclear plants by an average of 12 years. Nuclear power accounts for 23 percent of electricity production in Germany. The government is putting in place an ambitious plan to increase the share of electricity generated from renewable sources to 35 percent by 2020, up from around 18 percent now. Mr. Löscher called the government’s plans for renewable energy “the project of the century.” Although the government’s goal has met with skepticism in some quarters, he said the 35 percent figure was “achievable.” Mr. Löscher said the shift in strategy meant that Siemens would drop plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company that is planning to build dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades. Siemens might seek cooperation with Rosatom in other areas, Mr. Löscher said. The Siemens decision does not amount to a boycott of the nuclear energy industry. A spokesman said the company would continue to make systems that could be used in nuclear power stations. “We will provide conventional steam turbines that can be used for nuclear power plants and conventional power plants,” Alfons Benzinger, a spokesman for Siemens’s energy business, said Sunday. The energy division is Siemens’s second-largest in terms of revenue. Last year, the conglomerate had total revenue of €76 billion, or $105 billion, and net income of €4.1 billion. Of that, the energy division contributed €3.6 billion. Mr. Benzinger said the shift in strategy would not have a negative impact on the company’s overall sales. Siemens, which has more than 400,000 employees worldwide, makes products as diverse as high-speed trains and sophisticated medical equipment. It is now one of the world’s largest providers of environmental technologies, which last year generated €28 billion of its total revenue. Siemens said last year that its renewable energy unit — which is part of its environmental technologies division — had the strongest growth of any of its lines of business.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/business/global/19iht-siemens19.html","date":"Sep 19, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-430542531,"title":"China Plans Power Plants on the Sea for Islands","body":"HONG KONG — All the radar systems, lighthouses, barracks, ports and airfields that China has set up on its newly built island chain in the South China Sea require tremendous amounts of electricity, which is hard to come by in a place hundreds of miles from the country’s power grid. Beijing may have come up with a solution: floating nuclear power plants. A state-owned company, China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, is planning to build a fleet of the vessels to provide electricity to remote locations including offshore oil platforms and the contentious man-made islands, the state-run newspaper Global Times reported on Friday. The paper quoted an executive at the company, Liu Zhengguo, as saying that “demand is pretty strong” for the floating power stations, which would be built by one of its subsidiaries. In January, Xu Dazhe, the director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, told reporters in Beijing that China was planning to develop offshore floating nuclear energy plants, saying they “must undergo a rigorous, scientific evaluation,” but also linking these to China’s desire to become a “maritime power.” Mr. Xu said at the time that developing China’s nuclear power-generating capacity was part of the country’s five-year economic development plan, which runs through 2020. China has more civilian nuclear power stations under construction than any other country. China would not be the first country to employ floating nuclear power plants. In the 1960s, the United States Army installed a nuclear reactor inside the hull of a World War II freighter to provide electricity for the Panama Canal Zone. And nuclear power has been on vessels since 1955, when the commanding officer of the Nautilus , an American submarine, sent word that the craft was “underway on nuclear power.” Since then, nuclear reactors have provided propulsion — and electrical power — for ships like American aircraft carriers and Russian icebreakers. Typhoons regularly cross the South China Sea, and ships and submarines that run on nuclear power generally have the means to quickly sail away from a storm. It is unclear how mobile or seaworthy these reactor ships will be. Safety regulations for the seaborne reactors are being drawn up and reviewed, Global Times said, quoting Tang Bo, an official at China’s National Nuclear Safety Administration. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that in the event of a major nuclear accident at a floating barge, like a meltdown of the reactor core, winds could carry radioactivity to large population centers. “The floating nuke accident scenario also carries with it the potential for molten parts of the reactor core burning through the bottom of the barge to reach the water below,” Mr. Lochbaum wrote in an email. “The water is good for cooling, but not good for containment.” In the 1970s, an industry consortium called Offshore Power Systems also had plans for floating nuclear power plants in the United States. An electric utility had ordered a plant that would have been moored outside Atlantic City. The facility, which would have been built in Florida, was canceled, Mr. Lochbaum said. The Army’s floating nuclear reactor in the Panama Canal Zone provided power during the late 1960s and into the 1970s to the grid in what was then United States territory. But China would be placing floating atomic power stations at islands that until recently did not exist in seas claimed by several nations. The artificial islands built by the Chinese in the past two years in disputed waters of the South China Sea have stoked tensions with neighbors, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, and prompted the United States to assert its right to transit the area freely by sailing navy ships close to the islands, often shadowed by Chinese vessels. In February, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington reported that the Chinese were probably building radar facilities on several of the islands. That is in addition to airstrips capable of handling large jets like one on Fiery Cross Reef , harbors to berth seagoing vessels, lighthouses and large buildings such as barracks. All that requires electricity, provided now by generators and augmented by limited solar and wind power, said Gregory B. Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at C.S.I.S. Mr. Poling said it was too soon to tell how a possible deployment of the floating nuclear power stations would play out in the complicated politics of the South China Sea, though he said it was “potentially worrisome.” “But it appears that the idea hasn’t gotten any farther than conceptualization yet, so we seem to have years to wait before we find out,” Mr. Poling wrote in an email. A rendering of a possible Chinese floating nuclear power station was published on the English-language website of Global Times’s parent company, the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, People’s Daily. The image showed the small ship or barge next to a pier, surrounded by what looked like floating ice.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/world/asia/china-nuclear-power-south-china-sea.html","date":"Apr 22, 2016 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1545169790,"title":"\u0027The Truth About Chernobyl\u0027","body":"To the Editor: In his review of \"The Truth About Chernobyl\" by Grigory Medvedev (April 7), Loren Graham examines the painful lessons of that disaster, but his implied final reaction that nuclear power everywhere is a menace to life is unjustified. As members of a select scientific panel convened immediately after the Chernobyl accident, my colleagues and I established that the Chernobyl disaster tells us about the deficiencies of the Soviet political and administrative system rather than about problems with nuclear power. The design of the Chernobyl reactor was fundamentally faulty, having a built-in instability. In its operation on the critical day, all safety rules were totally ignored. Moreover, the electrical engineer who was put in charge of it had no knowledge of nuclear power, let alone of the instability of this particular reactor. By contrast, nuclear power plants that operate in the Western world are designed and built so as to preclude any possibility of a Chernobyl-type accident. In addition, Western plants are professionally operated in a manner infinitely superior to the Soviet practice at the time of the accident. In fact, in more than a quarter-century, with 112 nuclear power plants operating in the United States and an additional 200 similar ones operating throughout the world, the safety and environmental record of Western, non-Chernobyl nuclear power has been remarkable. No death or serious injury has been caused by radiation from any American-style light-water reactor anywhere in the world in 30 years of commercial nuclear power. Right now, the world needs nuclear energy sources to help reduce the massive burning of fossil fuels and their recognized environmental impact.

Its completion is a decade behind schedule. PARIS — On the windswept coast of Flamanville, an industrial city in northwest France facing the choppy waters of the English Channel, a soaring concrete dome houses one of the world’s most powerful nuclear reactors. But when this hulking giant will begin supplying power to France’s electrical grid is anyone’s guess. Construction is a full decade behind schedule and 12 billion euros, or $13 billion, over budget. Plans to start operations this year have been pushed back yet again, to 2024. And the problems at Flamanville are not unique. Finland’s newest nuclear power plant, which started operating last month, was supposed to be completed in 2009. As President Vladimir V. Putin’s war in Ukraine pushes Europe to sever its dependence on Russian natural gas and oil, nuclear power’s profile is rising, promising homegrown energy as well as reliable electricity. Nuclear energy could help solve Europe’s looming power crunch, advocates say, complementing a major pivot that was already underway before the war to adopt solar, wind power and other renewable technologies to meet ambitious climate-change goals. “Putin’s invasion redefined our energy security considerations in Europe,” said Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency. He added, “I would expect that nuclear may well make a step back in Europe and elsewhere as a result of the energy insecurity.” But turning a nuclear revival into a reality is fraught with problems. The dash to find ready alternatives to Russian fuel has magnified a political divide in Europe over nuclear power, as a bloc of pronuclear countries led by France, Europe’s biggest atomic producer, pushes for a buildup while Germany and other like-minded countries oppose it, citing the dangers of radioactive waste. A recent European Commission plan for reducing dependence on Russia pointedly left nuclear power off a list of energy sources to be considered.

Pool photo by Finnbarr Webster The long delays and cost overruns that have dogged the huge Flamanville-3 project, a state of the art pressurized-water reactor designed to produce 1,600 megawatts of energy, are emblematic of wider technical, logistical and cost challenges facing an expansion. A quarter of all electricity in the European Union comes from nuclear power produced in a dozen countries from an aging fleet that was mostly built in the 1980s. France, with 56 reactors, produces more than half the total. A fleet of up to 13 new-generation nuclear reactors planned in France, using a different design from the one in Flamanville, wouldn’t be ready until at least 2035 — too late to make a difference in the current energy crunch. Across the channel, Britain recently announced ambitions for as many as eight new nuclear plants, but the reality is more sobering. Five of the six existing British reactors are expected to be retired within a decade because of age, while only one new nuclear station, a long-delayed, French-led giant costing 20 billion pounds at Hinkley Point in southwest England, is under construction. Its first part is expected to come online in 2026. Others being considered in Eastern Europe aren’t expected to come online before 2030. “Nuclear is going to take so long” because the projects require at least 10 years for completion, said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the independent Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “The big problem is getting off Russian gas, and that problem is now — not in a decade, when maybe we’ve built another generation of nuclear reactors,” he added. Advocates say nuclear power can be a solution if the political will is there. Belgium’s government, in agreement with the country’s Green party, reversed a decision to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 and extended the life of two reactors for another decade as Russia intensified its assault on Ukraine last month. The energy will help Belgium avoid relying on Russian gas as it builds out renewable power sources, including wind turbines and solar fields, to meet European climate goals by 2035.

Gianfranco Tripodo for The New York Times “The invasion of Ukraine was a life changer,” Belgium’s energy minister, Tinne Van der Straeten, said last week, explaining the government’s U-turn. “We wanted to reduce our imports from Russia.” But in Germany, which is more dependent than any other European country on Russian gas and coal, the idea of using nuclear power to bridge an energy crunch appears to be going nowhere. Germany is scheduled to close its last three nuclear plants by the end of the year, the final chapter in a program that lawmakers approved to phase out the country’s fleet of 17 reactors after the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. Two of Germany’s largest energy companies said they were open to postponing the shutdown to help ease the nation’s reliance on Russia. But the Green party, part of Berlin’s governing coalition, ruled out continuing to operate them — let alone reopening three nuclear stations that closed in December. “We decided for reasons that I think are very good and right that we want to phase them out,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Parliament this month, adding that the idea of delaying Germany’s exit from nuclear power was “not a good plan.” Image The coal-fired Scholven power plant that provides energy for Germany. Credit... Martin Meissner/Associated Press Even in countries that see nuclear power as a valuable option, a host of hurdles lie in the way. “It is not going to happen overnight,” said Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a research organization. President Emmanuel Macron’s plans for a nuclear power renaissance in France envision a wave of large and small new-generation atomic reactors at an estimated starting price of €50 billion ($53 billion) — a staggering cost that other European countries can’t or won’t take on. Buildup won’t be fast, he acknowledged, in part because the industry also needs to train a new generation of nuclear power engineers. “Most governments push and push, and even if they start building it takes a long time,” Mr. Stern of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said. “All these other technologies are advancing rapidly and they’re all getting cheaper, while nuclear isn’t advancing and it’s getting more expensive.” In the meantime, many of France’s aging reactors, built to forge energy independence after the 1970s oil crisis, have been paused for safety inspections, making it difficult for French nuclear power to help bridge a Russian energy squeeze, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “Nuclear production will decrease in France this year unless you find a magic solution, but there is no magic solution,” she said. Still, Moscow’s aggression may help reverse what had been an arc of the industry’s gradual decline. Recently there has been a string of upbeat declarations. Besides Britain’s announcement this month to expand its nuclear capacity, the Netherlands, with one reactor, plans to build two more to supplement solar, wind and geothermal energy. And in Eastern Europe, a number of countries in Russia’s shadow had been making plans to build fleets of nuclear reactors — a move that advocates say appears prescient in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NuScale Power, an Oregon company selling a new reactor design that it claims will be cheaper and quicker to build because key components will be assembled in factories, has signed preliminary deals in Romania and Poland. Russia’s invasion has reinforced customers’ “desire to consider nuclear being part of the overall energy mix for their portfolios,” said Tom Mundy, the company’s chief commercial officer. Nuclearelectrica, the Romanian power company, is pushing ahead with both a NuScale plant and two Canadian reactors, to accompany a pair of nuclear facilities that generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, said Cosmin Ghita, the chief executive. “The Ukraine crisis has definitely shown us the need to bolster energy security,” Mr. Ghita said. “We are gaining more traction for our projects.” Meike Becker, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm, said that over the long term, Russia’s war was likely to “help the European idea” of being more energy independent. “That is something that nuclear can deliver,” she added.

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters All three nuclear power plants under Ukrainian control are back online and will soon be producing energy at normal capacity, the head of the national energy utility said on Friday, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants and required a halt to production. “Now the energy system is fully integrated; all regions are connected,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, the national utility. He added that utility crews are prepared to react to further Russian attacks, but urged consumers to save electricity. On Friday morning, electricity had been restored to meet about 70 percent of the country’s needs but rolling blackouts remained in place, Ukrenergo said in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. “Priority was given to critical infrastructure facilities in all regions,” the statement said, adding that efforts to reconnect household consumers were ongoing in “sub-zero” temperatures. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. Without electricity, taps run dry, water purification becomes unreliable, and wastewater is either not collected or has to be disposed of untreated. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said. For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who were without power on Thursday evening. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/25/world/russia-ukraine-war-news","date":"Nov 25, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-302210552,"title":"Italy Plans to Resume Building Atomic Plants","body":"ROME  Italy announced Thursday that within five years it planned to resume building nuclear energy plants, two decades after a public referendum resoundingly banned nuclear power and deactivated all its reactors. “By the end of this legislature, we will put down the foundation stone for the construction in our country of a group of new-generation nuclear plants,” said Claudio Scajola, minister of economic development. “An action plan to go back to nuclear power cannot be delayed anymore.” The change is a striking sign of the times, reflecting growing concern in many European countries over the skyrocketing price of oil and energy security, and the warming effects of carbon emissions from fossil fuels. All have combined to make this once-scorned form of energy far more palatable. “Italy has had the most dramatic, the most public turnaround, but the sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly all across Europe  Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and more,” said Ian Hore-Lacey, spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, an industry group based in London. The rehabilitation of nuclear power was underscored in January when John Hutton, the British business secretary, grouped it with “other low-carbon sources of energy” like biofuels. It was barely mentioned in the government action plan on energy three years earlier. Echoing the sentiment on Thursday, Mr. Scajola said, “Only nuclear plants safely produce energy on a vast scale with competitive costs, respecting the environment.” A number of European countries have banned or restricted nuclear power in the past 20 years, including Italy, which closed all its plants. Germany and Belgium have long prohibited the building of reactors, although existing ones were allowed to run their natural lifespan. France was one of the few countries that continued to rely heavily on nuclear power. Environmental groups in Italy immediately attacked any plan to bring back nuclear power. Giuseppe Onufrio, a director of Greenpeace Italy, called the announcement “a declaration of war.” Emma Bonino, an opposition politician and vice president of the Italian Senate, said building nuclear plants made no economic sense because they would not be ready for at least 20 years. “We should be investing more in solar and wind,” she said. “We should be moving much more quickly to improve energy efficiency, of buildings, for example. That’s something Italy has never done anything with.” But conditions were very different in the 1980s, when European countries turned away from nuclear power. Oil cost less than $50 a barrel, global warming was a fringe science and climate change had not been linked to manmade emissions. Perhaps more important for the public psyche, almost all of Europe’s nuclear bans and restrictions were enacted after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union in which radioactivity was released into the environment. The equation has changed. Today, with oil approaching $150 a barrel, most European countries, which generally have no oil and gas resources, have been forced by finances to consider new forms of energy  and fast. New nuclear plants take 20 years to build. Also, Europeans watched in horror in 2006 as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cut off the natural gas supply to Ukraine in a price dispute, leaving it in darkness. New green technologies, like solar power, wind and biofuel, cannot yet form the backbone of a country’s energy strategy, and it is not clear that they will ever achieve that level. Italy is the largest net energy importer in Europe, but nearly all European countries rely heavily on imported energy  particularly oil and gas. Enel, Italy’s leading energy provider, announced this year that it would close its oil-fired power plants because the fuel had become unaffordable. Italians pay the highest energy prices in Europe. Enel has been building coal plants to fill the void left by oil. Coal plants are cheaper but create relatively high levels of carbon emissions, even using the type of new “clean coal” technology Enel had planned. A few European countries, like Germany and Poland, could likewise fall back on their abundant coal reserves if they rejected oil and gas  but most of the coal mined in each country is of low grade and pollutes highly. After the government announcement opening Italy to nuclear power, Enel’s managing director, Fulvio Conti, said, “We are ready.” But he added that “new regulation and strong agreement on the plan within the country” would be needed. Enel, which operates power plants in several European countries, already has at least one nuclear plant, in Bulgaria, and has been researching so-called fourth-generation nuclear reactors, which are intended to be safer and to minimize waste and the use of natural resources. Italy’s old reactors still exist, but are too outdated to be reopened. New ones would have to be built. The Italian government laid out few specifics to back its announcement and officials at the Ministry of Economic Development said they were still studying issues like exactly what kind of plants could be built, and whether a new referendum would be required to re-open Italy to nuclear power. Marzia Marzioli, who leads a citizens’ campaign against new coal plants in Italy, said nuclear was equally repellent. “As with coal, nuclear energy is the exact opposite of what we would like for Italy.” “It is a choice that doesn’t consider the alternatives,” such as solar power, she said. To build nuclear plants, Italy would almost certainly have to improve its system of dealing with nuclear waste. The plants that were shut down years ago still store 235 tons of nuclear fuel.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/world/europe/23nukes.html","date":"May 23, 2008 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1089577254,"title":"Nuclear Power: Worth the Risk?","body":"?

That’s because the nuclear industry has long been hobbled by two problems that its boosters can’t really wish away: Nuclear is far slower to build than most other forms of power, and it’s far more expensive, too. And now there is a third problem on the horizon. As battery technology improves and the price of electricity storage plummets, nuclear may be way too late, too — with much of its value eclipsed by cheaper, faster and more flexible renewable power technologies. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — the goal set in the Paris Agreement to avert the worst effects of global warming — experts say that we need to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to a net of zero by 2050. Responding to such a climate emergency with nuclear power is like calling on a sloth to put out a house fire. The 63 nuclear reactors that went into service around the world between 2011 and 2020 took an average of around 10 years to build. By comparison, solar and wind farms can be built in months; in 2020 and 2021 alone, the world added 464 gigawatts of wind and solar power-generation capacity, which is more power than can be generated by all the nuclear plants operating in the world today. The nuclear industry has been notorious for cost overruns and delays. The only nuclear reactors under construction in the United States — a Westinghouse project at the Plant Vogtle power station in Georgia — were started in 2013 and projected to be finished in 2017. They are still not done — and an initial budget of $14 billion has more than doubled to over $28 billion. In 2017, utilities in South Carolina canceled two reactors midway through construction after cost projections ballooned from $11.5 billion to more than $25 billion. And after all this build time, you get a very expensive source of energy. In a common energy-industry measure known as “levelized cost,” nuclear’s minimum price is about $131 per megawatt-hour, which is at least twice the price of natural gas and coal, and four times the cost of utility-scale solar and onshore wind power installations. And the high price of nuclear power doesn’t include its extraneous costs, such as the staggering price of disasters. Cleanup and other costs for the 2011 Fukushima disaster, caused by an earthquake and a tsunami off the Japanese coast, may approach a trillion dollars.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/nuclear-power-still-doesnt-make-much-sense.html","date":"Sep 16, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1619848827,"title":"Utilities in Europe Seek Relief From the Heat","body":"Power companies in several European countries have asked for rules to be relaxed governing the temperature of water they pump back into rivers from their cooling systems because of the heat wave that continues to oppress the Continent. In France, government ministers agreed in an emergency session this morning to allow Électricité de France, the national utility and operator of the country\u0027s 56 nuclear power plants, to temporarily raise the maximum temperature of the cooling water that its plants pump into French rivers. The utility said in a statement that not only nuclear plants, but also those driven by coal and water power, were being affected. The utility said the heat wave \u0027\u0027deeply affects the coal, fuel, nuclear power output and hydropower production.\u0027\u0027 Électricité de France, which generates about 90 percent of French power, said it had already shut down a coal-fired plant at Vitry, outside Paris. In Germany, two states agreed to lift the permitted temperature limits. In Baden-Württemberg, in the southwest, the maximum allowed temperature of water from the state\u0027s two nuclear-driven plants was lifted to 30 degrees Celsius, about 86 degrees Fahrenheit, from 28. Bavaria, in the southeast, lifted the limit to 27 degrees Celsius, from 25, but limited the exemption to one month. French and German nuclear reactors are located along riverbanks to ensure sufficient supplies of cooling water. Governments generally impose limits on the temperatures of water that is poured back into rivers after cooling reactors to protect the environment and river life. The measures appeared certain to reinforce antinuclear arguments in France, where nuclear energy accounts for roughly 75 percent of energy generated. Nuclear energy has kept French electricity rates among Europe\u0027s lowest and has therefore been relatively well accepted. In Germany, where nuclear energy accounts for about a third of energy generated, the cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, consisting of Social Democrats and Greens, agreed three years ago to phase out the country\u0027s 19 nuclear power plants. But the complex agreement limits the life of existing reactors to an average of 32 years, meaning that nuclear energy will not be entirely eliminated for many years, if ever. In recent weeks, as temperatures in Europe reached record levels, demand has soared for electricity to run air conditioners and other cooling systems. By last month, temperatures at some Électricité de France reactors had reached such high levels that the utility began experimenting with temporary sprinkling systems, dousing the exterior shells of several reactors and earning harsh criticism for applying do-it-yourself methods to the problem. Roselyne Bachelot, the French environment minister, said the release granted to the energy industry would be limited in duration, though she did not elaborate. At a news conference, she said, \u0027\u0027You cannot fail to envisage cuts in power because, given the general situation in Europe, we don\u0027t have a spare tire.\u0027\u0027 Environmentalists and opponents of nuclear energy attacked the French decision. An umbrella organization of French groups opposed to nuclear power, Get Out Of Nuclear, assailed what it called \u0027\u0027scandalous dispensations\u0027\u0027 to the energy industry \u0027\u0027with the sole objective of protecting nuclear energy.\u0027\u0027 Greenpeace said in a statement that the situation \u0027\u0027does nothing if not reveal the fragility of the French power system based almost entirely on nuclear energy.\u0027\u0027","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9403EFD71031F931A2575BC0A9659C8B63","date":"Aug 12, 2003 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":591537716,"title":"2 Endorsements of Nuclear Power, but Sharp Differences on Details","body":"Contrary to what Democrats may think, there is more to John McCain’s energy program than “drill, baby, drill.” And contrary to what Mr. McCain has been saying on the campaign trail, where he proposes the construction of 45 nuclear plants by 2030, Barack Obama does not “oppose the use of nuclear power.” Both men endorse nuclear energy, although to differing degrees, as part of their strategy to wean the United States from its dependence on foreign oil. While Mr. McCain includes the building of nuclear reactors among his preferred options to obtain more energy, Mr. Obama assigns a higher priority to developing renewable sources like solar, wind and bio-fuels and increasing efficiency in the consumption of existing sources. “I think that nuclear power should be in the mix when it comes to energy,” Mr. Obama said in June in Jacksonville, Fla., but added, “I don’t think it’s our optimal energy source, because we haven’t figured out how to store the waste safely or recycle the waste.” Mr. McCain says on his campaign Web site that “nuclear power is a proven, zero-emission source of energy, and it is time we recommit” to expanding its use. He also argues that it is “critical that the U.S. be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our own country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times.” Because nuclear energy is virtually carbon neutral, some environmentalists who opposed its use now are more open to it. Elgie Holstein, an adviser to Mr. Obama on energy issues, accused the McCain campaign of misrepresenting Mr. Obama’s position on nuclear power. “Some specific proposals that Senator McCain has made are troubling,” Mr. Holstein said, because of the problems of storage and reprocessing, and the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear fuel. “Senator Obama definitely understands that nuclear power plays a major role in our electricity mix and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future,” Mr. Holstein, a former Energy Department official said. “He doesn’t favor shutting down power plants and hasn’t come out against extending their licenses, so it is simply incorrect to say he is anti-nuclear-power.” It is probably safe to say that Democrats as a group are less enthusiastic than Republicans about nuclear energy. The 57-page platform adopted at the Democrats’ convention in Denver in August does not mention nuclear power. Mr. Obama is from Illinois, which has more nuclear reactors than any other state, and during the Democratic primary season drew fire from rivals for donations he had received from the company that operates those reactors. In his acceptance speech in Denver, Mr. Obama vowed that as president he would “find ways to safely harness nuclear power.” Mr. McCain restated his support for nuclear power in the first two presidential debates, and criticized Mr. Obama. Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, did not respond to phone calls and e-mail messages over a one-month period requesting an interview with one of Mr. McCain’s energy advisers to elaborate on Mr. McCain’s stance. On the campaign trail, Mr. McCain has repeatedly cited France as a model for the development of nuclear power in the United States. In France, 59 nuclear power plants generate nearly 80 percent of the country’s electricity, helping to reduce carbon emissions and producing a surplus that has made France one of the largest net electricity exporters in the world. In France, the government controls both the construction of nuclear power plants and the generation and distribution of electricity. “Putting aside the question of whether it is advisable to have an electricity system dominated by one mode of generation, it is a little odd for him to point to the heavily subsidized French case and say we should be emulating it,” Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said of Mr. McCain. “It would take a massive shift in government policy to proceed in the French direction, and it would be antithetical to the United States and how it operates, since it would be a quasi-socialist system.” In campaign speeches, Mr. McCain also estimates that his program to build nuclear reactors would “provide 700,000 jobs for American workers.” Some nuclear power experts offer more modest figures, noting that much of the heavy foundry work and other tasks would have to be done overseas, at least in the initial phase. But Mr. McCain has said he wants such work to be done within the United States, even though he noted in July in Missouri that “our manufacturing base to even construct these plants is almost gone,” and added, “We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in a highly technical field.” Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace and the co-chairman of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, a pro-nuclear group, estimated that each reactor would cost up to $8 billion and would generate 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 800 permanent jobs once in operation. Asked to provide a ballpark figure on employment if all 45 reactors were to be built, Mr. Moore, responded, “225,000 good union jobs that you can support a family on.” Trade groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute favor plans similar to Mr. McCain’s proposal to build 45 nuclear reactors, but some energy experts say that would require billions of dollars in new subsidies and be an inefficient use of taxpayers’ money, no matter how many jobs were generated. Those experts seem to prefer Mr. Obama’s promise to invest $150 billion in clean-energy projects over 10 years, the bulk of which would probably be directed toward non-nuclear energy sources. “The two big hurdles to the construction of nuclear plants in the United States are that they are not economically competitive and cannot be privately financed, so the real issue McCain should be addressing is how he proposes to pay for them,” said Tom Cochran, a physicist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “You’re simply penalizing the programs and technology that include improvements in energy efficiency and can provide climate mitigation more quickly, cheaply and safely.” Mr. McCain has sought to defuse concerns about the safety of reactors by noting his own service aboard the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Enterprise. During the more than 50 years that the United States Navy has deployed nuclear vessels, “there has never been an accident,” he said recently in a campaign swing through Florida. Strictly speaking, that statement is not correct. While it is true there has never been a known fatal accident involving nuclear material aboard a naval vessel, vessels have suffered blowback from radioactive waste or leaked radioactive coolant water in domestic waters and foreign ports, which generated complaints from governments in Japan and Singapore. In large part because of safety concerns, the two candidates disagree on whether the federal government should build a nuclear storage facility at Yucca Mountain, Nev., about 90 miles north of Las Vegas. Mr. McCain favors the proposal. Mr. Obama opposes it, arguing that a better short-term solution is to continue to store nuclear waste at the reactors that produce it “until we find a safe, long-term disposal solution that is based on sound science.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/politics/10nuclear.html","date":"Oct 10, 2008 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1273591248,"title":"Blown Pipe in Japan Nuclear Plant Accident Had Been Used, but Not Checked, Since 1976","body":"A section of steam pipe that blew out Monday, killing four workers at a Japanese nuclear power plant, had not been inspected in 28 years and had corroded from nearly half an inch to a thickness little greater than metal foil, authorities said Tuesday. \u0027\u0027To put it bluntly, it was extremely thin,\u0027\u0027 Shoichi Nakagawa, Japan\u0027s minister of the economy, trade and industry, said Tuesday after touring the power plant, in Mihama, about 200 miles west of here. \u0027\u0027It looked terrible, even in the layman\u0027s view.\u0027\u0027 Although the carbon steel pipe carried 300-degree steam at high pressure, it had not been inspected since the power plant opened in 1976. In April 2003, Nihon Arm, a maintenance subcontractor, informed the Kansai Electric Power Company, the plant owner, that there could be a problem. Last November, the power company scheduled an ultrasound inspection for Saturday. \u0027\u0027We thought we could postpone the checks until this month,\u0027\u0027 Akira Kokado, the deputy plant manager, told reporters at Mihama. \u0027\u0027We had never expected such rapid corrosion.\u0027\u0027 But on Monday, four days before the scheduled shutdown for the inspection, superheated steam blew a two-foot-wide hole in the pipe, scalding four workmen to death and injuring five others seriously. The steam that escaped was not in contact with the nuclear reactor, and no nuclear contamination has been reported. Initial measurements showed that the steam had corroded the affected section of pipe from its original thickness of 0.4 inches to 0.06 inches, less than one-third the minimum safety standard. Kansai Electric said in a statement that the pipe \u0027\u0027showed large-scale corrosion.\u0027\u0027 \u0027\u0027We conducted visual inspections but never made ultrasonic tests, which can measure the thickness of a steel pipe,\u0027\u0027 said Haruo Nakano, a Kansai Electric spokesman. In response, Japan\u0027s nuclear and industrial safety agency ordered ultrasound inspections at four other power companies that own nuclear plants with the same type of pressurized water reactors. The inspections will involve nearly half of Japan\u0027s 52 nuclear power plants. The Kyodo news agency reported Wednesday that corrosion problems had prompted operators in recent years to replace the steam pipes at 16 plants of a design similar to that of the plant at Mihama. With television news helicopters swarming over the Mihama plant on Monday, government officials were quick to promise that a full investigation would take place. \u0027\u0027We must put all our effort into determining the cause of the accident and to ensuring safety,\u0027\u0027 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said Tuesday. He added that the government would respond \u0027\u0027resolutely, after confirming the facts.\u0027\u0027 On Tuesday, the police opened an investigation to determine why 221 workers were in the reactor facility at the time of the accident.

Kyodo reported that investigators believed that the company might have neglected safety standards by allowing workers to prepare for an annual inspection while the plant was still running.

The footage was released by the Energoatom State Company. Credit Credit... Energoatom State Company KYIV, Ukraine — A powerful Russian missile exploded less than 900 feet from the reactors at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant just after midnight on Monday, Ukrainian officials said, narrowly avoiding a possible nuclear calamity and underscoring the threat posed by the Kremlin’s assaults on critical infrastructure across Ukraine. There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the nuclear power plant, which remained fully operational, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said. No casualties were immediately reported. But the explosion caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station in the industrial zone that surrounds the nuclear complex. It forced the shutdown of one of the plant’s hydraulic units and caused partial power outages in the area. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian national television that while the heavily fortified concrete buildings that house nuclear reactors are built to withstand a plane crash, the blast from Monday’s strike was powerful enough to have damaged the containment structures had the missile struck closer. “There is no other way to characterize this except for nuclear terrorism,” he said. The extent of the damage was still being investigated, officials said, as was the type of missile used. Preliminary information pointed to an Iskander cruise missile, Ukraine’s southern military command said in a statement. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a statement that the strike had caused a brief disconnection of three power lines at the nuclear plant but that they were automatically reconnected. All of the plant’s reactors were now operating normally, he added, but warned: “A few hundred meters and we would have woken up in a completely different reality.” The South Ukraine plant, Ukraine’s second-largest functioning nuclear power station, is some 300 miles west of the larger Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces and has come under repeated shelling. Energoatom said on Monday that “the Russian army launched a missile attack on the industrial zone of the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant” at 12:20 a.m., causing “a powerful explosion” whose shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the nuclear plant. The company released security camera footage that showed a massive fireball lighting up the night sky over the site. The nuclear plant, near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv region, is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, which includes the hydroelectric plant and one other power station. It lies more than 100 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv and far from any frontline fighting.

I believe Mr. Reagan does not make pronouncements lightly without backup: witness his statements and action on \u0027\u0027Star Wars\u0027\u0027 and on tax increases. Does he have a plan to reduce nuclear weapons? I would like to know what he would do with the weapons material we have produced over the last 40 years. One must remember that plutonium, which is the major weapons material, has a half-life of 24,000 years, which means that it would take a quarter of a million years to dispose of plutonium by decay only. This is not realistic; the only way to get rid of plutonium is to use it to make fuel for civilian nuclear-power reactors. Positive verification for disposal of plutonium could be achieved if each country agreed to sell and deliver equal quantities of material to civilian power producers. The International Atomic Energy Agency could monitor this activity. With the quantity of plutonium in weapons today, it would take decades to burn up the weapons material in reactors in the United States, the Soviet Union and other nuclear-power countries. We must, therefore, look upon the world\u0027s nuclear-power plants as a means for disposing of nuclear weapons rather than as bomb-producing factories, as some anti-nukes view nuclear-power plants. Without civilian nuclear-power reactors, the alternative is to live in fear of nuclear weapons forever.

The Air Force is exploring the possibility of building several hundred small nuclear reactors that would generate electrical power in a protracted nuclear war, according to Air Force, Department of Energy, Congressional and industry officials. The reactors, which would be transported by air around the country and overseas, would produce emergency electrical power for computers, communication lines, weapon launching sites, support equipment and repair shops, the officials said. They would be used if the commercial power grid on which the Air Force relies were destroyed by nuclear attack. The officials estimated that the plan would take five years to execute and would cost about $20 billion. The Department of Defense has requested $5.5 million for the project in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. That money would be for partial payment of an $11.9 million contract being negotiated between the Government and Westinghouse. Six Companies Sought Role Six companies in the nuclear industry submitted design concepts, and Westinghouse was selected to submit a detailed design for reactors that could produce 10 megawatts, according to Gary S. Flora, the Air Force\u0027s Associate Director of Engineering and Services. The dimensions and weight of the reactors and the nature of containers and other safety devices for transporting them have not yet been decided. If the program goes into production, the Air Force and Department of Energy would probably place the first orders in the United States in more than 10 years for nuclear power plants. Politically, the project, which officials said the Air Force had tried to keep out of the public eye, seems likely to provoke dispute as it proceeds. Vital to Administration Strategy On one side, the officials said, the project is vital to the Reagan Administration\u0027s strategy for fighting a nuclear war and to the Air Force, which is charged with developing most of the weapons and supporting structure to fight such wars. The nuclear industry that would produce the reactors deemed likely to support the project. On the other side would most likely be antiwar groups, environmentalists who oppose nuclear power and a variety of people who would say the plan will add to the Federal deficit. Much of the debate will probably go on in the Congress, which must approve all funds for research, development and production of the nuclear reactors. Reliance on Commercial Grids Today, the Air Force depends largely on commercial power grids for electricity to operate everything from gyroscopes aboard ballistic missiles standing ready in silos to support facilities for bombers armed with nuclear bombs or cruise missiles. Air Force officials have testified before Congress that daily power requirements for bases today range from 5 to 60 megawatts during peak demand and cost $900 million last year. The officials have estimated that wartime demands would be double that requirement. The electric power grids are highly vulnerable to attack, sabotage and terrorism, Air Force officials said. Only small diesel generators and batteries would be available in emergencies, and many of those would be as vulnerable as the commercial power supply. The generators, moreover, would require oil or gasoline, supplies which are certain to be disrupted during a nuclear war. New Sources Must Be Sought Thus, the officials said, the Air Force is seeking sources of electricity that could be protected from repeated nuclear attacks and could continue to provide power to command posts, communications apparatus and weapons as American nuclear forces kept firing. The Reagan Administration\u0027s doctrine for protracted nuclear war has called for the deployment of the MX intercontinental missile; the Trident 2 submarine-launched missile; the B-1 bomber and the Stealth bomber, the latter designed to evade detection by radar, and a variety of cruise missiles. Administration officials have said survival of communications would be the critical element in a nuclear conflict. The President, his senior aides and military commanders must be able to get information relayed from space and around the world, and to transmit orders to dispersed forces. After a survey of bases, Mr. Flora told a House subcommittee 11 days ago that \u0027\u0027the key components of our energy supply and distribution systems are vulnerable to accident, natural disaster, terrorism, sabotage, war and economic actions.\u0027\u0027 Each Could Cost $75 Million Mr. Flora told the Science and Technology Committee\u0027s Subcommittee on Energy Research and Production: \u0027\u0027The Department of Energy recommended small nuclear reactors as one viable option which could satisfy our needs and proposed to assist us in the evaluation of this potential.\u0027\u0027 Congressional officials informed about the program said each nuclear reactor would cost between $65 million and $75 million to build when the line is at full production. Thus, 300 such reactors could cost about $20 billion. Underground concrete and steel shelters would be designed to protect the reactors.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9B0DE0D91F38F933A05750C0A961948260","date":"Mar 30, 1987 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":457401001,"title":"A Gift From the ’70s: Energy Lessons","body":"The presidential candidates claim to see America’s energy future, but their competing visions have a certain vintage quality. They’ve revived that classic debate: the hard path versus the soft path. The soft path, as Amory Lovins defined it in the 1970s, is energy conservation and power from the sun, wind and plants — the technologies that Senator Barack Obama emphasizes in his plan to reduce greenhouse emissions. Senator John McCain is more enthusiastic about building nuclear power plants, the quintessential hard path. As a rule, it’s not a good idea to revive anything from the 1970s. But this debate is the exception, and not just because the threat of global warming has raised the stakes. The old lessons are as good a guide as any to the future, as William Tucker argues in “ Terrestrial Energy ,” his history of the hard-soft debate. The initial debate over nuclear power seemed to end not long after the partial meltdown in 1979 of the reactor at Three Mile Island. Utilities canceled orders and stopped building reactors, partly because of public fears, but perhaps mainly because of rising costs. Mr. Lovins and his allies liked to say that nuclear power, once promoted as “too cheap to meter,” had now become “too expensive to matter.” The soft path seemed to be the way to go, particularly when some of Mr. Lovins’s predictions about energy conservation came true. As Americans cut back in response to higher prices and new incentives, the growth in electricity demand slowed. Some public officials, most enthusiastically in California, told utilities to stop building large power plants. Instead, they subsidized wind farms and solar power, which were supposed to be cheap and plentiful alternatives once the technologies matured. Instead, they remained so costly and scarce that Californians’ electricity rates were among the highest in America. They endured rolling blackouts in 2000 while paying astronomical prices for power from nuclear and fossil-fuel plants in other states. The crisis was attributed to price controls and Enron’s market manipulation, but the underlying problem was a shortage of power that forced the state to start building old-fashioned fossil-fuel plants for itself. Meanwhile, there was a surprise on the hard path, too. Once utilities stopped building reactors, the share of electricity from nuclear power was projected to decline steadily as the oldest reactors were retired. But then several new “merchant energy” companies began assembling fleets of reactors sold off by local utilities. The new owners standardized operations, retrained workers and brought in human-factor engineers to redesign the famously indecipherable control panels. Under the old owners, the reactors were balky white elephants operating only 60 percent of the time. By improving maintenance and preventing mistakes, the new owners kept them running 90 percent of the time and won permission to upgrade their capacities. So even as the nuclear industry was shrinking in the last two decades as the oldest reactors shut down, the remaining ones were profitably generating an increasing share of the country’s electricity. Today about 20 percent of electricity in America is generated by nuclear power, which is about 20 times the contribution from solar and wind power. Nuclear power also costs less, according to Gilbert Metcalf , an economist at Tufts University. After estimating the costs and factoring out the hefty tax breaks for different forms of low-carbon energy, he estimates that new nuclear plants could produce electricity more cheaply than windmills, solar power or “clean coal” plants. The outlook could change, of course, if new nuclear plants turn out to be more expensive than expected, or if engineers make breakthroughs in other technologies. (To debate these possibilities, go to www.nytimes.com/tierneylab.) Given the uncertainties, Dr. Metcalf cautions, it would be risky to bet everything on nuclear power as the answer to global warming. But it seems even riskier to bet on just the soft path, as so many greens are doing, either by flatly opposing nuclear power or by setting so many conditions that no plants could be built for decades, if ever. (Mr. Obama says nuclear power is necessary but should not be expanded until security and safety issues are addressed.) “The nuclear debate is still stuck back in the 1980s,” says Mr. Tucker, the author of “Terrestrial Energy,” the new brand he’s trying to affix to nuclear power. If people started associating nuclear plants with natural radioactive processes in the Earth instead of atomic bombs, he says, they might be persuaded that it’s the most environmentally benign form of energy, particularly compared with wind farms that cover scenic ridges and the vast solar arrays proposed for “empty” land in deserts. Mr. Tucker, a journalist who has been debunking environmental alarms for decades, says he has come around to Al Gore’s view on the danger of global warming, and he’d like environmentalists to rethink their views, too. “Even when greens give grudging support to nuclear power,” he says, “they add the caveat, ‘But first we have to make sure the plants are absolutely safe’ — as if reactors haven’t been operating safely for 25 years. Nobody recognizes the complete overhaul that has occurred in the industry or how it’s now pumping out twice as much electricity from the same plants with a vastly improved safety record.” By scaring people about the tiny levels of radiation emitted during the normal operation of a nuclear plant, Mr. Tucker says, greens have effectively encouraged the construction of coal plants that actually release more radiation because of the traces of uranium in coal dust. He argues that the risks of terrorist attacks and nuclear waste have been exaggerated, particularly by the environmentalists who objected when the Yucca Mountain nuclear-waste depository was being designed to guarantee a level of safety for only 10,000 years. They successfully sued to enforce a safety standard extending one million years — which, in an ideal world, would be a very nice standard. But if you believe global warming is a planetary crisis that must be addressed immediately, should you really be obsessing about hypothetical dangers near one mountain in A.D. 1,000,000?

Instead, power companies, in their greed, focused on profits. What could the power companies have been thinking when they built reactors on geologically active faults both in Japan and California? Although reactors need to be near a large body of water for cooling purposes, there are many such locations without active faults. Nuclear power can be a safe source of power, without carbon emissions, if we would only spend the money to make it safe. Since many countries have reactors, it makes sense to form a nuclear reactor consortium, financed by those countries with nuclear power, to do research on how to build safe reactors and how to dispose of nuclear waste. Too much time has already been spent on dealing with accidents that could have been avoided if we had the proper knowledge, and we are continually frustrated by the lack of a solution for waste disposal. Robert Ackerberg Massapequa, N.Y., March 22, 2011  To the Editor: Contrary to what Frank N. von Hippel writes in “ It Could Happen Here ” (Op-Ed, March 24), America’s nuclear power plants are well equipped to handle the impacts of severe events, whatever the cause. In recent years, nuclear plants have maintained safety in the direct path of Hurricanes Katrina and Andrew. Nonetheless, our industry is taking steps to make nuclear energy facilities even safer. Companies are verifying each power station’s capability to withstand conditions that result from severe events, including the loss of significant operational and safety systems. They are also verifying that the capability to maintain safety of reactors even in a total loss of electric power is proper and functional. The global nuclear industry is providing technical assistance and equipment as Japan continues to restore cooling systems at the Fukushima reactors. Significant changes after Three Mile Island have led to high safety and reliability at 104 reactors in the United States. As utilities do after significant events such as this, we will apply safety and security upgrades as warranted as part of our commitment to generate electricity safely and reliably. Scott Peterson Senior Vice President Nuclear Energy Institute Washington, March 24, 2011  To the Editor: Are we to take seriously Frank N. von Hippel’s argument that the ultimate deaths of a mere 10,000 people as a result of Chernobyl, compared with the tens of thousands of people killed by particulates from coal, suggest that the nuclear industry is “remarkably safe”? Mr. von Hippel’s assertion that running nuclear power plants is “relatively cheap” once construction costs have been paid conveniently ignores the costs of decommissioning, security for the plant post-closure and radioactive waste storage in perpetuity. Advocates for nuclear power who fail to address this staggering legacy of hidden costs are misleading the public. H. James Quigley Jr. Stony Brook, N.Y., March 24, 2011 The writer is a lecturer in the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook University.  To the Editor: The detection of radioactive iodine 131 in Tokyo’s drinking water (“ Anxiety Up as Tokyo Issues Warning on Its Tap Water ,” front page, March 24), in amounts considered unhealthy for children, makes clear that potassium iodide must be administered if children are to be adequately protected against thyroid cancer caused by ingested and inhaled iodine 131. Interdiction of milk supplies, though important, is plainly insufficient. Japan’s apparent preparedness with potassium iodide contrasts with the situation in the United States. In response to 9/11, Congress passed a law to create stockpiles of potassium iodide for populations within a 20-mile radius of nuclear reactors, rather than the 10-mile radius within which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission offers it to states that request it. But the N.R.C., which had opposed the law, fought successfully to keep it from taking effect. In 2008 President George W. Bush’s science adviser, John H. Marburger III, declared that potassium iodide was not needed beyond the 10-mile radius, and that the law therefore would not be implemented. The events in Japan demand that the Obama administration act quickly to reverse this unjustified rejection of a sensible law.

But this is a new era, dominated by fears of tight energy supplies and global warming. Suddenly nuclear power is looking better. The nuclear industry recently trotted out two new leaders of its campaign to encourage the building of new reactors. They are Christie Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace. This campaign is the latest sign that nuclear power is getting a more welcome reception from some environmentalists who have moved on to bigger worries. True, most environmental organizations remain adamantly opposed to any expansion of nuclear power and instead look to conservation and renewable energy to get us out of the fossil fuel age. But when the ecologist James Lovelock -- creator of the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth and all its organisms behave as if they were a single living system -- urges his colleagues to drop their \u0027\u0027wrongheaded opposition\u0027\u0027 to nuclear energy, it is clear that fissures are developing. There is good reason to give nuclear power a fresh look. It can diversify our sources of energy with a fuel -- uranium -- that is both abundant and inexpensive. More important, nuclear energy can replace fossil-fuel power plants for generating electricity, reducing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute heavily to global warming. That could be important in large developing economies like China\u0027s and India\u0027s, which would otherwise rely heavily on burning large quantities of dirty coal and oil. But nuclear power should not be given a free pass in our frantic quest for energy and environmental security. Making any real dent in carbon emissions could require building many hundreds or even thousands of new nuclear plants around the world in coming decades, a hugely ambitious undertaking fraught with challenges. As nuclear expertise and technologies spread around the world, so does the risk that they might be used to make bombs. Unfortunately, the Bush administration erred badly when it signed a nuclear pact with India that would undercut the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. That misguided deal needs to be repudiated by the Senate. We can only hope that it does not undercut a more promising administration plan to keep the most dangerous fuel-making technologies out of circulation by supplying developing nations with uranium and taking the spent fuel rods back. There remains the unsolved problem of what to do with the radioactive waste generated by nuclear plants. Many people are unwilling to see a resurgence in nuclear power without some assurance that the spent fuel can be handled safely. The Energy Department\u0027s repeated setbacks in efforts to open an underground waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada do not inspire confidence, but there is no reason why the spent fuel rods can\u0027t be stored safely at surface sites for the next 50 to 100 years. More problematic is the administration\u0027s long-term solution for waste disposal. It wants to recycle the spent fuel in a new generation of advanced reactors that would use technologies that don\u0027t yet exist, following a timetable that many experts think unrealistic. Its current approach is apt to be costly and would leave dangerous plutonium more accessible to terrorists. Nuclear power has a good safety record in this country, and its costs, despite the high initial expense of building the plants, are looking more reasonable now that fossil fuel prices are soaring. How much impact it could really have in slowing carbon emissions has yet to be spelled out, but there is no doubt that nuclear power could serve as a useful bridge to even greener sources of energy.

Credit it for candor. Nuclear energy is a flop, and the power sources of the future will be sun, wind and water. They may be indeed, although the evidence is a shade less compelling than the otherwise intelligent documentary seems to think. It will be seen on Channel 13 at 10 o\u0027clock tonight. At the opening, Meryl Streep, the unseen narrator, describes the energy battle this way: \u0027\u0027The struggle pits the long-established use of limited and potentially hazardous resources against a mix of new technologies that rely on renewable resources like the sun.\u0027\u0027 In a struggle like that, of course, we know which side we\u0027re supposed to be on. Only a lobbyist would prefer a limited and potentially hazardous resource over old Sol. Who wants acid rain, uppity oil sheiks and other unpleasantnesses? Meanwhile, as Miss Streep notes: \u0027\u0027Nuclear power has been attacked by its critics as unsafe for nearly three decades. Ironically, the nuclear industry has been more crippled in recent years by concerns over costs than over safety.\u0027\u0027 This is true. The nuclear power industry has been afflicted by cost overruns, management failures and, its spokesmen insist, burdensome government regulations. At the same time, the nuclear power industry, although it has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, has had to battle cultural and political forces that hold it to be immoral. \u0027\u0027Power Struggle\u0027\u0027 shows us representatives of Mothers for Peace and the Abalone Alliance, among others, making their cases. Therefore, it\u0027s worth noting, which the documentary barely does, that the rest of the world sees nuclear power differently. France, for example, expects its Government-run nuclear industry to meet 55 percent of the country\u0027s electrical energy needs by 1990. And grant that sun, wind and water are attractive possibilities; \u0027\u0027Power Struggle\u0027\u0027 is still awfully zealous in its determination to promote them. Thus it gives us a \u0027\u0027renewable-energy advocate\u0027\u0027 who says the nuclear energy industry misspent the best part of $125 billion. He may be correct; a cover story in Forbes magazine used that same figure last February. Then, however, he speaks of the industry\u0027s \u0027\u0027$75 billion in Federal subsidies.\u0027\u0027 All this, he says, led to \u0027\u0027the greatest tragedy in our whole industrial history.\u0027\u0027 In fact, the nuclear power industry does not get Federal subsidies, and the $75 billion figure is made of blue smoke. Later we are told that the construction of nuclear plants has been \u0027\u002770 percent subsidized,\u0027\u0027 a figure equally murky. \u0027\u0027Power Struggle\u0027\u0027 -a Public Policy Production - seems so fearful the mismanaged nuclear industry will rise from the ashes that it must bury it any way it can. This is unnecessary because \u0027\u0027Power Struggle,\u0027\u0027 when it gets down to cases, does have interesting things to say about alternative energy. It shows us, for example, the solar thermal plant of Southern California Edison - 1,800 mirrors in the Mojave Desert that concentrate the sun\u0027s rays into a boiler that produces steam. It also shows us Altamont Pass in California, the largest \u0027\u0027wind farm\u0027\u0027 in the world. Thousands of windmills are harnessed to produce electricity. Are projects like these the hope of the future? \u0027\u0027Power Struggle\u0027\u0027 isn\u0027t entirely persuasive, but certainly it\u0027s provocative.

Even before the radioactive dust flung skyward by a burning Soviet reactor has settled, new fears about the safety of nuclear power are being voiced around the world. Students of the nuclear industry said that some countries, especially France and Japan, would probably forge ahead with plans to expand nuclear energy despite the Soviet disaster, both because they believe their technologies to be safe and because they face little serious public opposition. But experts predicted that construction of new nuclear plants would be curtailed elsewhere. In Western Europe, the Soviet disaster has added new kindling to already fiery debates about the future of nuclear power. With the exception of France, the nuclear industry in Western Europe has been stagnating, with little new construction and few orders for future plants. A Slackening of Demand The industry\u0027s woes have been attributed to economic factors, including a slackening of projected electrical demand and high interest rates as well as a surge in public concern about safety in the wake of the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. Now, in the shadow of a far worse accident that has sprinkled several countries with radioactive fallout, Western European opposition to nuclear energy seems certain to widen and deepen, experts believe. \u0027\u0027In Europe outside France, the effect on future reactor orders is going to be paralyzing,\u0027\u0027 said Andrew Holmes, editor of European Energy Report, a newsletter published in London. \u0027\u0027This accident will make it far more difficult for new plants to be built,\u0027\u0027 said David Albright, a nuclear specialist at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington. A Positive View of Prospects But a spokesman for the American nuclear power industry expressed a more positive view. \u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think the Soviet accident will sharply reduce the growth of nuclear power,\u0027\u0027 said Eugene Gantzhorn of the Atomic Industrial Forum in New York. He noted that nearly all commercial reactors in other countries used a safer technology than the Soviet plant, which has graphite core reactors that are seldom built in the West and lack containment buildings to deter the escape of radiation. \u0027\u0027I believe common sense will prevail, and this will not stop needed nuclear power programs around the world,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Gantzhorn said. Nuclear power now provides 15 percent of the world\u0027s electricity. Mr. Holmes, speaking by telephone, predicted that the Soviet accident might derail nuclear plans in four countries that were on the verge of ordering new reactors - the Netherlands, Italy, Finland and Britain. He said the accident had strengthened opponents of nuclear energy in additional countries, including West Germany and Switzerland. He said the accident could slow the planned expansion, with Soviet assistance, of nuclear energy in Eastern Europe, a region lacking in domestic energy resources. East European Voices Concern Yesterday an East European diplomat observed that a plant identical to the stricken Chernobyl station was under construction in his country. \u0027\u0027What are we supposed to do now?\u0027\u0027 the diplomat asked in frustration. He said some East European countries had formed committees to examine the implications of the Soviet disaster for their own energy futures. The Soviet Union has laid plans to more than double nuclear energy output in the next five years, to nearly 70,000 megawatts, from 28,000 megawatts in operation at the end of 1985. Soviet energy planners consider the growth of nuclear capacity essential in the European regions of their country, which are getting short on fossil fuel sources, and Western experts declined to speculate about how Moscow\u0027s staunchly pro-nuclear policy might be affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Three European countries have rejected nuclear power in recent years. In 1978, Austria decided not to open an already built reactor, while Sweden, after the Three Mile Island incident, decided to phase out its 10 existing reactors by 2010. Last year Denmark decided to forgo the nuclear option. German Debate Intensifies In West Germany, which depends on nuclear reactors for about a third of its electricity, this week\u0027s disaster intensifed a debate over nuclear power. On Wednesday, the Green Party renewed its antinuclear campaign at a news conference, displaying signs reading, \u0027\u0027Chernobyl Is Everywhere,\u0027\u0027 evoking signs held by demonstrators after the Three Mile Island accident that said \u0027\u0027Harrisburg Is Everywhere.\u0027\u0027 The West German Government said the Soviet accident would have no effect on plans to add five more reactors to the 20 already operating. But some observers predicted that the antinuclear forces, especially vocal in the 1970\u0027s, would be strengthened anew. Nuclear power development in Britain has been stalled for years by a debate over what type of, if any, new reactors should be built. At a minimum, the Soviet accident appeared likely to delay still longer an awaited decision by the Government, after three years of hearings and debate, over whether to build Britain\u0027s first pressurized water reactor, a Westinghouse model that is a departure from previously built gas-cooled reactors. Nuclear reactors are also manufactured by General Electric, Babcock \u0026 Wilcox and Combustion Engineering of the United States; Siemens-Kraftwerk Union of West Germany, Framatome of France, British General Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., as well as by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Britain Affirms Its Policy An official in the Prime Minister\u0027s office said it was \u0027\u0027ludicrous\u0027\u0027 to suggest that British energy policy would be deflected by the Soviet accident, but opponents of nuclear power are mounting new protests. \u0027\u0027I think this may have tipped the balance against nuclear development here,\u0027\u0027 said Mr. Holmes, the London energy analyst. France has been opening reactors at a rate of four a year, but the pace of construction is expected to slow, not because of qualms about the technology but because reactors already under construction are expected to meet most of the projected electricity needs. France derives nearly two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power. The Soviet accident \u0027\u0027is not leading us to change our activities or policies,\u0027\u0027 Michel Lajus, head of a Government committee on nuclear safety said this week. Effective public opposition has not emerged. Japan Is One-Fourth Nuclear Japan now gains more than a quarter of its electricity from 32 nuclear reactors. Eleven more are under construction and six others are planned. Opponents of nuclear power wield little political influence and experts doubted whether the Chernobyl disaster would slow the push for more nuclear energy in Japan, which is totally dependent on imports for oil.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/02/world/nuclear-disaster-ever-widening-impact-after-accident-soviet-station-nuclear.html","date":"May 2, 1986 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-2099525702,"title":"Possibly Unavoidable Answer On Climate","body":"Japan’s announcement last week that it would not meet its promise to sharply reduce its carbon emissions met a chorus of disapproval from around the world. Delegates at the international climate talks in Warsaw, which end Friday, lamented Japan’s move as a blow to worldwide efforts to slow global warming. In the Philippines, which is still collecting the dead from Typhoon Hayan, it served as yet another example of the indifference of the rich world to the plight of the world’s poorest nations on the front lines of climate change. But Japan’s about-face on its climate promises — which followed the government’s decision to shut down its nuclear power generators after the meltdown at the Daiichi nuclear plant in Fukushima — is also an opportunity for a reality check in the debate over how to slow the accumulation of greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. It brings into sharp focus the most urgent challenge: How will the world replace fossil fuels? Can it be done fast enough, cheaply enough and on a sufficient scale without nuclear energy? For all the optimism about the prospects of wind, sun and tides to power our future, the evidence suggests the answer is no. Scrambling to find an alternative fuel to generate some 30 percent of its power, Japan had no choice but to turn to coal and gas. A few years ago, it promised that in 2020 it would produce 25 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than in 1990; last week it said it would, instead, produce 3 percent more. Japan is unlikely to be the only country to miss its targets. In response to the Fukushima disaster, Germany shut down eight nuclear reactors and said it would close the remaining nine by 2022. Everybody is promising to fill the gap with renewables. So far, however, coal and natural gas have won out. CO2 emissions in Germany actually increased 1 percent last year , even as they declined in the United States and most of Western Europe. Between 2010 and 2012, worldwide consumption of nuclear energy shrank 7 percent. Over the same period, the consumption of coal, the dirtiest fuel and the worst global warming offender, rose 4.5 percent. Data released on Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project confirmed that coal accounted for over half the growth in fossil fuel emissions in 2012. With energy consumption expected to grow by more than half over the next 30 years , the odds seem low that the world can avoid catastrophic warming without carbon-free nuclear power. Opponents of nuclear energy say the case for nuclear power underestimates its costs and unique risks, including the fact that no other energy source can produce the sudden devastation of a nuclear meltdown. And they say that nuclear proponents overstate the challenge that renewable energy faces in replacing fossil fuels. But while investment in renewable sources is crucially important to meet new energy needs, nuclear power remains the cheapest and most readily scalable of the alternative energy sources. Difficult as it may be to reduce dependence on coal, nuclear power is probably the world’s best shot. Take the Energy Information Agency’s estimate of the cost of generating power. The agency’s number-crunchers include everything from the initial investment to the cost of fuel and the expense to operate, maintain and decommission old plants. Its latest estimate, published earlier this year, suggests that power generated by a new-generation nuclear plant that entered service in 2018 would be $108.40 per megawatt-hour. (A megawatt-hour is enough to supply an hour’s worth of electricity to about 1,000 American homes.) This is not cheap. Even if the government were to impose a carbon tax of $15 per metric ton of CO2, a coal-fired plant would generate power at $100.10 to $135.50 per MWh, depending on the technology. Plants using natural gas could produce electricity for as little as $65.60 per MWh, even after paying the carbon tax. Still, nuclear power is likely to be cheaper than most power made with renewables. Land-based wind farms could generate power at a relatively low cost of $86.60 per MWh, but acceptable locations are growing increasingly scarce. Solar costs $144.30 per MWh, the agency estimates. A megawatt-hour of power fueled by an offshore wind farm costs a whopping $221.50. Even these comparisons underestimate the challenges faced in developing wind and solar power on a large scale. They might be clean and plentiful sources, but they require expensive transmission lines from where the sun shines and the wind blows to where the power is needed. Moreover, the sun doesn’t shine at least half the time. The wind doesn’t always blow. And we don’t yet know how to store electricity generated on hot summer days to use on cold winter nights. The sun has provided half of Germany’s power on some days. On others it has provided next to nothing. It’s not easy to build a power network, let alone an economy, on the basis of such an unreliable energy source. Perhaps the most levelheaded estimate of the relative cost of alternative fuels comes from the British government, which earlier this year published the price it was prepared to guarantee power generators as an incentive to develop renewable sources . The exercise underscored just how uncompetitive alternative sources of energy are, compared with coal and gas. It also revealed that nuclear power generated at a new plant in Somerset was expected to be significantly cheaper . The British government offered to guarantee a price of £92.50 per MWh of power generated at the Somerset plant. For offshore wind, the guarantees ranged from £155 per MWh at plants starting next year to £135 per MWh for those starting in 2018. What about the danger of nuclear power? What about the fish swimming in cesium-laced waters off the coast of Japan or the tens of thousands of evacuees fleeing radioactive fallout? In 2007 The Lancet medical journal published a study comparing deaths and illnesses associated with different sources of electricity — both from environmental pollution and accidents. Nuclear energy, it found, was about the safest around . Nuclear energy was responsible for 0.003 accidental deaths per terawatt-hour generated. Coal-fired electricity accounted for 15 times as many. “More than 10 years of operations would be needed before a single occupational death could be attributed to the plant” at a new French reactor, wrote the authors, Anil Markandya from the University of Bath and Paul Wilkinson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history, produced 50 additional deaths from cancer in 20 years, according to a study by 100 scientists from eight United Nations agencies . Of 800,000 people exposed to its radiation, a maximum of 4,000 may eventually die from cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Any such deaths are tragic, but there are downsides to all energy sources. The strongest evidence that nuclear energy is much safer than the public believes comes, of all places, from Japan. In 1945, the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then, 500 of the 100,000 or so survivors — 0.5 percent — have died prematurely because of radiation exposure.  Six decades worth of analysis of this population suggests the risks from radiation are unexpectedly low . The climate change scientist James Hansen, former head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, argues that nuclear energy will save lives. In fact, it has prevented some 1.8 million air pollution-related deaths already. The good news is that the sun and the wind are not the world’s only alternative to fossil fuels. There are risks associated with nuclear power, but it looks a lot better than the energy we’ve got.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/business/economy/unavoidable-answer-to-problem-of-climate-change.html","date":"Nov 19, 2013 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":788812843,"title":"Germans and Swiss Reassess Nuclear Operations","body":"BERLIN — With the crisis in Japan raising fears about nuclear power, Germany and Switzerland said on Monday that they would reassess the safety of their own reactors and possibly reduce their reliance on them. Doris Leuthard, the Swiss energy minister, said Switzerland would suspend plans to build and replace nuclear plants. She said no new ones would be permitted until experts had reviewed safety standards and reported back. Their conclusions will apply to existing plants as well as planned sites, she added. Swiss authorities recently approved three sites for new nuclear power stations. Germany will suspend “the recently decided extension of the running times of German nuclear power plants,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. “This is a moratorium and this moratorium will run for three months.” She said the suspension would allow for a thorough examination of the safety standards of the county’s 17 nuclear power plants. “There will be no taboos,” Mrs. Merkel said. Even when the three months is over, Mrs. Merkel warned, there would be no going back to the situation before the moratorium. Across Europe, officials worried about the Continent’s use of nuclear power as cooling systems failed at a third nuclear reactor in Japan and officials in that country struggled to regain control. The European Union called for a meeting on Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities and operators to assess Europe’s preparedness. Austria’s environment minister, Nikolaus Berlakovich, called for a European Union-wide stress test “to see if our nuclear power stations are earthquake-proof.” In Germany, with Mrs. Merkel’s center-right coalition facing important regional elections this month, the move was apparently in part an effort to placate the influential antinuclear lobby and give her coalition some breathing space before making a final decision about nuclear energy. The foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called for a new risk analysis of the country’s nuclear plants, particularly regarding their cooling systems. He is the leader of the pro-business Free Democratic Party, which strongly supports nuclear power. A previous government, led by the Social Democrats and Greens, pushed through legislation in 2001 to close all of the country’s nuclear plants by 2021. But Mrs. Merkel’s center-right government reversed that decision last year and voted to extend the lives of the plants by an average of 12 years. Nuclear energy provides about 11 percent of Germany’s energy supply but its contribution to electricity output is about 26 percent. In Switzerland, the suspension of plans to build and replace plants will affect all “blanket authorization for nuclear replacement until safety standards have been carefully reviewed and if necessary adapted,” Ms. Leuthard, the energy minister, said in a statement. Switzerland has five nuclear reactors, which produce about 40 percent of the country’s energy needs. Ms. Leuthard said she had already asked the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate to analyze the exact cause of the problems in Japan and draw up new or tougher safety standards “particularly in terms of seismic safety and cooling.” In Russia, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said his government would not revise its ambitious program of building nuclear reactors but would “draw conclusions from what’s going on in Japan,” Russian news agencies reported. Nuclear power currently accounts for 16 percent of Russia’s electricity generation.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/business/global/15euronuke.html","date":"Mar 14, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-2095975362,"title":"Four Workers Killed in Nuclear Plant Accident in Japan","body":"Superheated steam erupted from the ceiling of a nuclear power plant north of Kyoto on Monday, killing four workers and severely burning five others. It was Japan\u0027s worst nuclear accident. Officials said the steam was not contaminated by radioactivity. No evacuations were ordered of the town of Mihama, where the plant is situated. The Sea of Japan port is about 40 miles north of Kyoto, the country\u0027s historic capital. \u0027\u0027Radioactive materials weren\u0027t contained in the steam that leaked out,\u0027\u0027 an official for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said at a news conference here. The Kansai Electric Power Company, owner of the 28-year-old reactor at Mihama, said in a statement, \u0027\u0027This incident will have no radiation effect on the surrounding environment.\u0027\u0027 But the accident is likely to add to Japanese concerns about nuclear power, just as high oil prices and the war in Iraq make it more attractive to economic planners here. With the world\u0027s third largest nuclear power industry, after the United States and France, Japan relies on 52 nuclear power plants to generate almost one-third of the nation\u0027s electricity. But it has also been heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East and has worked aggressively with Russia over the last year to develop oil and gas deposits in Siberia. A government plan calls for building 11 more nuclear plants and raising the percentage of the nation\u0027s power supplied by nuclear energy to nearly 40 percent by 2010. But these plans have stalled as the public has become increasingly wary of nuclear power. Many towns have held referendums, voting against building nuclear plants. Wariness has been fueled by accidents and by a cover-up culture in which employees show far greater loyalty to their companies than to the public\u0027s right to know. Last summer, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the nation\u0027s largest utility, was forced to close all 17 of its nuclear plants temporarily after admitting that it had faked safety reports for more than a decade. \u0027\u0027After the Tepco scandal of two years ago, today\u0027s accident would accelerate people\u0027s worry and suspicion about the safety management of the nuclear power plants,\u0027\u0027 Satoshi Fujino, a staff member at Citizens\u0027 Nuclear Information Center, a private nuclear power watch organization, said in an interview. \u0027\u0027This plant is pretty old, and there are many plants even older.\u0027\u0027 While the accident on Monday appeared not to involve radioactive releases, the horrific nature of the deaths has augmented the publicity. \u0027\u0027Staff rushed in screaming,\u0027\u0027 a 65-year-old company cafeteria worker told Kyodo News. \u0027\u0027I put in a container all the ice I could find and gave it.\u0027\u0027 Company officials said the accident took place in the turbine building of the No. 3 nuclear reactor in Mihama, which was scheduled to be closed Saturday for routine maintenance. About 200 workers were in the building at 3:30 p.m., when a two-foot-wide hole burst in a steel pipe that carried steam, pressurized and heated to as much as 400 degrees. All of the dead and injured men had been working in the second-floor room where the pipe burst. \u0027\u0027The ones who died had stark white faces,\u0027\u0027 Yoshihiro Sugiura, a doctor who treated them, told The Associated Press. \u0027\u0027This shows they had rapidly been exposed to heat.\u0027\u0027 The United States had a similar accident at the Surry nuclear power plant in southern Virginia almost two decades ago, when an 18-inch steel pipe burst and released 30,000 gallons of boiling water and steam, killing four people. Japanese nuclear safety officials said it would be impossible for the leaked steam to contain radioactivity because the water in the steam turbines does not come in contact with water used as a coolant for the reactor. Kansai Electric said it closed the 826,000-kilowatt nuclear generation unit at the reactor and was not sure when it would be restarted. A Kansai Electric official said at the news conference that the company was trying to determine the cause of the accident, and that the other two reactors at the complex would continue running. Yosaku Fuji, president of Kansai Electric, apologized and bowed deeply before reporters at the televised news conference. \u0027\u0027We are deeply sorry to have caused so much concern,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027There is nothing we can say to the four who lost their lives. We pray for their souls from the bottom of our hearts and offer our condolences to their families. We are truly sorry.\u0027\u0027 With the accident occurring on the 59th anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki, political and industry leaders were quick on Monday to assure the public that a thorough investigation would take place. \u0027\u0027I think we must do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat, and to implement safety measures,\u0027\u0027 said Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Takuya Ito, the public relations director of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, expressed concern in an interview that the accident could further hurt popular trust in nuclear power \u0027\u0027because these are the first deaths from an accident in a nuclear power plant in operation.\u0027\u0027 The most recent fatality in the nuclear power industry was in 1999, at a fuel-reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo, when a radiation leak killed two workers, exposed 600 people to low levels of radiation, and caused the evacuation of thousands of residents. That accident was caused by three workers who tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium in buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks. Two of the workers who caused the disaster later died from their injuries. More recently, in February, eight workers were exposed to low-level radiation at another power plant when they were accidentally sprayed with contaminated water. The doses were not considered dangerous. On Monday, a small fire broke out at a nuclear facility in Shimane Prefecture, 375 miles southwest of Tokyo. No one was injured and it posed no threat of radiation leaks. \u0027\u0027A fire broke out at a waste processing site, where we also have a laundry facility. But it was quickly extinguished,\u0027\u0027 said a spokesman for Chugoku Electric Power Company, which operates the site.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9403E2D7113CF933A2575BC0A9629C8B63","date":"Aug 10, 2004 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1509912574,"title":"McCain at Nuclear Plant Highlights Energy Issue","body":"NEWPORT, Mich.  Senator John McCain toured a nuclear power plant in Michigan on Tuesday to highlight his support for the construction of 45 new nuclear power generators by 2030, a position that he said distinguished him from his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama. Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, portrayed his support of nuclear energy as part of an “all-of-the-above approach” to addressing the nation’s energy needs at a time of $4-a-gallon gasoline. He called it “safe, efficient, inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil.” “If we really want to enable new technologies tomorrow like plug-in electric cars, we need electricity to plug into,” he said in a statement after touring the Fermi 2 nuclear plant, its twin cooling towers spewing vapors used as a backdrop. “We need to do all this and more.” Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama see expanded use of nuclear energy as a way to reduce dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels, although Mr. Obama has cautioned that the government must first consider issues like the disposal of nuclear waste and the security of nuclear materials. Even before Mr. McCain left South Dakota, where he campaigned at the freewheeling Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on Monday night, and headed to the plant in Michigan, Mr. Obama’s campaign had put out a statement rebuffing what it called Mr. McCain’s misrepresentation of Mr. Obama’s position on nuclear power. “Barack Obama supports safe and secure nuclear energy,” Bill Burton, a campaign spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “Nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity. It is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option. However, before an expansion of nuclear power is considered, Obama thinks key issues must be addressed including: security of nuclear fuel and waste, waste storage, and proliferation.” Those concerns, as well as the near meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, and the ability to generate electricity cheaply in other ways, left the nuclear reactor construction business moribund for decades. More than 100 reactor orders were canceled in the 1970s, including all those ordered after 1973, and billions of dollars of work was abandoned. But market conditions have improved as demand for power has risen and the price of natural gas, a competing fuel, has jumped. Lately some environmental groups that had been critical of nuclear power have embraced it, seeing the technology as a way to meet the nation’s growing energy demands without contributing more heat-trapping gases. In addressing the nation’s energy demands, Mr. Obama has focused on alternative energy sources like wind and solar, as well as conservation, which would apparently also be the main beneficiaries of the decade-long $150 billion government investment effort he promises if elected. He barely mentions nuclear power, usually just alluding to it in a sentence here or there. “I think we do have to look at nuclear,” he said in an interview this spring on “Meet the Press,” “and what we’ve got to figure out is can we store the material properly? Can we make sure that they’re secure? Can we deal with the expense?” In his appearance at the nuclear plant, Mr. McCain expressed none of those doubts or concerns, asserting in his statement that the construction of the 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 would create 700,000 jobs, a figure that many experts find to be inflated. He also said his experience serving on the nuclear-fueled aircraft carrier Enterprise had convinced him of the safety of nuclear power. Mr. McCain took no questions and limited his appearance to his statement and a tour of the plant with a single reporter and a photographer, part of a recent campaign strategy to limit his availability to the news media. During the tour, while standing in the center of the plant’s control room, surrounded by elaborate panels and consoles crammed with switches and green and red lights, he asked several questions related to the plant’s safety. “What would give you great cause for concern?” he asked Phillip Skarbek, the shift manager, and Anthony F. Earley Jr., the chief executive of DTE Energy, the owner of the plant, who conducted the tour. The plant has had a troubled history, with its original generating station, Fermi 1, which opened in 1957, suffering a partial fuel meltdown on Oct. 5, 1966. No outside contamination occurred, but Fermi 1 was taken off line in 1972 and decommissioned in 1975. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says it expects to receive applications by the end of 2010 to build 34 nuclear plants, although only a handful are likely to be finished in the next decade. If demand for electricity continues to rise, as seems likely, it will be hard for the industry to maintain market share, much less displace the main carbon dioxide emitters, plants that burn coal. To try to jump-start the nuclear construction business, Congress in 2005 gave the industry three incentives. It provided loan guarantees of up to $18.5 billion, which would cover up to 80 percent of the value of a new reactor; it offered financial credits for producing electricity; and it offered a form of insurance to compensate for regulatory delays. Still, the so-called nuclear renaissance is moving slowly. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 was signed by President Bush on Aug. 8 of that year and has yet to produce a plant order.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/us/politics/06nuke.html","date":"Aug 6, 2008 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-547741037,"title":"Nuclear Power License","body":"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has unanimously approved a license to the Commonwealth Edison Company for the second reactor at its nuclear power plant in Braidwood, Ill., near Chicago, to operate at full power.

All have combined to make this once-scorned form of energy far more palatable. “Italy has had the most dramatic, the most public turnaround, but the sentiments against nuclear are reversing very quickly all across Europe  Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and more,” said Ian Hore-Lacey, spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, an industry group based in London. Nuclear power’s rehabilitation was underscored earlier this year when John Hutton, British Business Secretary, grouped it with “other low-carbon sources of energy” like biofuels. It had barely been mentioned in the government’s action plan on energy three years earlier. Echoing the sentiment on Thursday, Mr. Scajola said: “Only nuclear plants safely produce energy on a vast scale with competitive costs, respecting the environment.” A number of European countries have banned or restricted nuclear power over the last 20 years, including Italy, which closed all its plants. Germany and Belgium have long prohibited the building of new reactors, although operating ones were allowed to run their natural lifespan. France was one of the few countries that continued relying heavily on nuclear power. Environmental groups in Italy immediately attacked any plan to bring back nuclear power. Giuseppe Onufrio, a director of Greenpeace Italy, called it “a declaration of war.” Emma Bonino, an opposition politician who is vice president of the Italian Senate, said that it made no economic sense to build nuclear plants because they would not be ready for 2o years or longer. “We should be investing more in solar and wind,” she said. “We should be moving much more quickly to improve energy efficiency, of buildings, for example. That’s something Italy has never done anything with.” But conditions were very different in the 1980s, when European countries turned away from nuclear power: Oil cost under $50 a barrel, global warming was a fringe science and climate change had not been linked to man-made emissions. Perhaps more important for the public psyche, Europe’s nuclear bans and restrictions were almost all enacted in the years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union. The equation has changed: Today, with oil approaching $150 a barrel, most European countries, which generally have no oil and gas resources of their own, have been forced by finances to consider new forms of energy  and fast. New nuclear plants take 20 years to build. Also, instead of Chernobyl, Europeans have more recently watched in horror as Russian president Vladamir Putin cut off the natural gas supply to Ukraine in a price dispute, leaving that country in darkness. New green technologies, like solar power, wind and biofuel, have not yet been scaled up to the point where they can form the backbone of a country’s energy strategy, and it is not clear that they will ever achieve that success. Italy is the largest net energy importer in Europe, but nearly all European countries rely heavily on imported energy  particularly oil and gas. ENEL, Italy’s leading energy provider, announced this year it would close its oil-fire power plants because the fuel had become unaffordable. Italians pay the highest energy prices in Europe. ENEL has been building new coal plants to fill the void left by oil, a move that created controversy in itself: coal plants are cheaper but create relatively high levels of carbon emissions, even using the type of new “clean coal” technology that ENEL had planned. A few European countries, like Germany and Poland, could likewise fall back on their abundant coal reserves if they turned away from oil and gas  but most of the coal mined in both countries is low grade and highly polluting. After today’s government announcement opening Italy to nuclear power ENEL’s managing director, Fulvio Conti, said “We are ready.” But he added that “new regulation and strong agreement on the plan within the country” would be needed. ENEL, which operates power plants in a number of European countries already has at least one nuclear plant, in Bulgaria, and has been researching so called 4th generation nuclear reactors. Italy old reactors still exist, but are too outdated to be re-opened and new ones would have to be built. The Italian government laid out few specifics plan to back its announcement and in calls to the ministry, officials said they were still studying issues like exactly what kind of plants could be built and, whether a new referendum would be legally required to re-open Italy to nuclear power. Indeed, Marzia Marzioli, who leads a citizens’ campaign against new coal plants in Italy, said nuclear was equally repellent. “As with coal, nuclear energy is the exact opposite of what we would like for Italy. “It is a choice that doesn’t consider the alternatives,” such as solar power, she said. To build nuclear plants, Italy would almost certainly have to improve its system of dealing with nuclear waste. Two hundred and thirty five tons of nuclear fuels are still being stored in the old plants that were shut down years ago. Ms. Bonino said she was concerned that Italy would be unable to safely process nuclear waste from new reactors and also that fuel could be supplied to rogue states trying to acquire nuclear capability. “I think this plan is being offered to satisfy the business community but I worry that security and waste are issues,” she said.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/world/europe/23nuke.html","date":"May 23, 2008 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1284303704,"title":"Nuclear Power Expansion in China Stirs Concerns","body":"SHENZHEN, China  China is preparing to build three times as many nuclear power plants in the coming decade as the rest of the world combined, a breakneck pace with the potential to help slow global warming. China’s civilian nuclear power industry  with 11 reactors operating and construction starting on as many as an additional 10 each year  is not known to have had a serious accident in 15 years of large-scale electricity production. And with China already the largest emitter of gases blamed for global warming, the expansion of nuclear power would at least slow the increase in emissions. Yet inside and outside the country, the speed of the construction program has raised safety concerns. China has asked for international help in training a force of nuclear inspectors. The last country to carry out such a rapid nuclear expansion was the United States in the 1970s, in a binge of reactor construction that ended with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. And China is placing many of its nuclear plants near large cities, potentially exposing tens of millions of people to radiation in the event of an accident. In addition, China must maintain nuclear safeguards in a national business culture where quality and safety sometimes take a back seat to cost-cutting, profits and outright corruption  as shown by scandals in the food, pharmaceutical and toy industries and by the shoddy construction of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan Province earthquake last year. “At the current stage, if we are not fully aware of the sector’s over-rapid expansions, it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants,” Li Ganjie, the director of China’s National Nuclear Safety Administration, said in a speech this year. A top-level corruption scandal is already unfolding in the nuclear industry. In August, the Chinese government dismissed and detained the powerful president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Kang Rixin, in a $260 million corruption case involving allegations of bid-rigging in nuclear power plant construction, according to official media reports. No charges have been reported against Mr. Kang, who is being held incommunicado for interrogation. While none of Mr. Kang’s decisions publicly documented would have created hazardous conditions at nuclear plants, the case is a worrisome sign that nuclear executives in China may not always put safety first in their decision-making. In contrast with its performance in industries like toys, China has a strong safety record in industries like aviation, which receive top-level government attention. The challenge for the government and for nuclear companies as they increase construction is to keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners. “It’s a concern, and that’s why we’re all working together because we hear about these things going on in other industries,” said William P. Poirier, a vice president for Westinghouse Electric, which is building four nuclear reactors in China. Philippe Jamet, the director of the division of nuclear installation safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said that China had welcomed foreign inspectors at its reactors and that “they show pretty good operations safety.” But he added that the international agency was concerned about whether China would have enough nuclear inspectors with adequate training to handle the rapid expansion. “They don’t have very much staff, when you compare their staff with how many they will need,” Mr. Jamet said. The agency accepted a Chinese request to send a team of international experts to the country next year to assess staffing and training, he added. In late October, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ordered a quintupling of the safety agency’s staff by the end of next year, to 1,000, according to United States regulators. Chinese officials did not respond to requests for confirmation. China has two rival state-owned nuclear power giants: the China National Nuclear Corporation, mainly in northeastern China, and the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group, mainly in southeastern China. Western experts regard the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, which mainly uses French designs and is run by China Guangdong Nuclear, as evidence that China can run reactors safely. A display case holds trophies the power plant won in global safety competitions. China National Nuclear likewise cooperates with international inspectors and has had no reported mishaps. But its roots are in a government ministry with close ties to the former Soviet Union, making it more of an enigma to most Western experts, and the corruption case has added to their concern. China National Nuclear was on track to grow faster than China Guangdong over the next decade. China National Nuclear has sought to hush up the case involving the arrest of its president, deleting from its Chinese-language Web site even the most minor news releases that mentioned Mr. Kang. In a faxed response to questions, China National Nuclear made no mention of Mr. Kang, but emphasized that its plants met international standards. The arrest of Mr. Kang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Central Committee, can be seen as evidence of China’s seriousness about safety. Today, China’s nuclear plants can produce about nine gigawatts of power when operating at full capacity, supplying about 2.7 percent of the country’s electricity. Three years ago, the government set a goal of increasing that capacity more than fourfold by 2020. The government will soon announce a further increase in its targets, to 70 gigawatts of capacity by 2020 and 400 gigawatts by 2050, said Jiang Kejun, an energy policy director at the National Development and Reform Commission, the main planning agency. Electrical demand is growing so rapidly in China that even if the industry manages to meet the ambitious 2020 target, nuclear stations will still generate only 9.7 percent of the country’s power, by the government’s projections. Bringing so much nuclear power online over the next decade would reduce the country’s energy-related emissions of global warming gases by about 5 percent, compared with the emissions that would be produced by burning coal to generate the power. “For anyone concerned about carbon dioxide emissions, it’s heartening, but it’s only a piece of the puzzle,” said Jonathan Sinton, a China specialist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. China, which by most estimates overtook the United States in 2006 to become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is seeking sharp improvements in the energy efficiency of its economy. But the economy is growing so fast that even if the country can meet its goals, total emissions will rise 72 to 88 percent by 2020, Mr. Sinton said. The challenge for China is to build and operate its nuclear reactors without the equivalent of the Three Mile Island accident, in which a reactor core partly melted and released radioactivity, or the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986, the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident. China does not use the kind of reactor that exploded at Chernobyl. And engineers in China study the mistakes that poorly trained operators made at Three Mile Island. Liu Yanhua, a vice minister of science and technology, said China believed that its nuclear industry would continue to grow safely. “So far,” Mr. Liu said, “there is no damage.”","url":"https://www.tipsproject.eu/tips/","date":"Dec 15, 2009 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1408417661,"title":"Ontario Considers Building a Nuclear Plant","body":"With Ontario on the brink of an energy supply squeeze, and some of its aging nuclear plants facing an uncertain future, moves are under way in the province, Canada\u0027s most populous, to build the first nuclear reactor in North America in more than two decades Memories of last August\u0027s power blackout, which was felt in a wide swath of southern Ontario as well as in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States, have only increased pressure for the province to become more self-sufficient. Ontario\u0027s energy minister, Dwight Duncan, said in a recent interview that in any overhaul of the power sector, the province would have to consider nuclear energy. \u0027\u0027The use of nuclear power is controversial,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027We have some significant decisions to make.\u0027\u0027 Introducing a bill to streamline regulation of the power sector and to attract private sector investment, Mr. Duncan said earlier this week, \u0027\u0027It is absolutely critical that we move forward quickly to boost new supply, increase conservation and maintain price stability for consumers.\u0027\u0027 A new nuclear plant would most likely be built on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, where Ontario\u0027s three existing nuclear plants are. It would be the first in North America since confidence in atomic energy was shattered by an accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979. Energy policy in Canada is largely in the hands of the provinces, and a committee set up by the Ontario government to examine power supplies concluded in March that \u0027\u0027the right nuclear strategy will play a key role in ensuring that Ontario has reliable, competitively priced power over the long term.\u0027\u0027 The panel, whose chairman was John Manley, a former deputy prime minister of Canada, said that the province \u0027\u0027must begin planning now to supplement and ultimately replace its aging nuclear assets with new and better generations of nuclear technology.\u0027\u0027 Mr. Duncan, Ontario\u0027s energy minister, said in an interview that his government would probably decide this fall on the future role of nuclear power in the province. According to Roger W. Gale, chief executive of GF Energy, an industry consulting firm based in Washington with clients on both sides of the border, while \u0027\u0027the United States is at the study stage, Canada could potentially be at the doing stage.\u0027\u0027 Canadian authorities are more likely to support the nuclear industry than their American counterparts, he and other experts said. Ontario is facing tight energy supplies, and a government-owned Canadian company ready and eager for new business has supplied every existing nuclear reactor in the country. The approval and other regulatory processes for new nuclear plants is also simpler in Canada. And public opposition will probably be more muted north of the border. The last fulfilled order for a nuclear power plant in the United States was in 1973; Canada\u0027s last was in 1978. Since then, almost all sizable generating stations built in either place have been fueled either by coal or, more recently, natural gas, though several other countries, like China, Japan, India and Russia, have continued to build nuclear plants. Ontario\u0027s existing nuclear power plants have been dogged by problems. Several units of the Pickering plant, east of Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario, and the Bruce plant, on the shores of Lake Huron, have not been restarted since they were taken out of service seven years ago for safety reasons. Nuclear power accounts for 45 percent of electricity generating capacity in Ontario, but 14 percent in Canada. That compares with 20 percent in the United States, where several proposals for new nuclear plants are inching forward. Various consortiums -- among them, one that includes the Exelon Corporation of Chicago and the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans, two of the country\u0027s largest nuclear plant owners -- are in the early stages of applying for licenses to build and operate new plants. In May, the Department of Energy agreed to finance half the $4.25 million cost of a detailed study by a different group, led by the Tennessee Valley Authority, to build two nuclear generating units at a site near Hollywood, Ala. Construction of any American projects is not expected to start before 2010 at the earliest, however, said J. Scott Peterson, a vice president at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade group in Washington. The sense of urgency is considerably greater in Canada, where, experts say, construction could begin a couple of years earlier. Mr. Duncan said Ontario needed to refurbish, replace or conserve 25,000 megawatts of generating capacity by the year 2020, equal to 80 percent of current power supplies. He estimated that these investments would cost 25 billion to 40 billion Canadian dollars ($18 billion to $29 billion). At the same time, the provincial government, seeking to cut pollution, has pledged to phase out all five of Ontario\u0027s coal-fired generating stations by 2007, plants that now generate about a fifth of the province\u0027s electricity. Compounding the drive for new capacity is uncertainty over the future of three idled units at the big Pickering plant, run by the government-owned Ontario Power Generation. The estimated cost of repairs to these and another unit that was restarted last year, originally 1.1 billion Canadian dollars, has escalated to 3 billion to 4 billion Canadian dollars. The authorities are now mulling whether to press ahead with the repairs or abandon the reactors. With the coal plants destined for oblivion and the attraction of natural gas diluted by volatile prices, some consider nuclear the clear favorite for expansion of the province\u0027s base load power capacity. \u0027\u0027There\u0027s certainly a climate now where it\u0027s being seriously considered,\u0027\u0027 said Duncan Hawthorne, chief executive of Bruce Power, the company that operates the 6,200-megawatt Bruce station on Lake Huron. Another factor favoring the nuclear option is the development of a new reactor by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a government corporation known for its heavy-water Candu -- Canada Deuterium Uranium -- plants. All 17 reactors currently operating in Canada are Candu models. Ian Dovey, a company spokesman, said it expected to win regulatory approval for the new model, known as the ACR-700, by the end of 2006. According to Tom Adams, executive director of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based research group that campaigns against nuclear power, the climate is friendlier toward the nuclear industry in Canada than in the United States in large part because of government support for Atomic Energy of Canada. Mr. Gale, the Washington consultant, said that if all went smoothly, construction work on a new nuclear plant in Ontario could begin by 2008. But numerous obstacles must be overcome. According to Mr. Hawthorne of Bruce Power, there needs to be greater certainty on the cost and financing of a new plant, as well as the selling price of its output. Bruce Power\u0027s 2,300-acre site, 150 miles northwest of Toronto, is a possible location for a new plant. Mr. Hawthorne said that the company would probably decide within the next year whether to refurbish those of its eight existing reactors nearing the end of their lives by 2012, or build new ones, or both. The prospect of new nuclear plants has so far raised little public concern in Ontario. Glenn R. Sutton, the mayor of Kincardine, the town closest to the Bruce plant, describes the local community as \u0027\u0027pro-nuclear.\u0027\u0027 Most of Bruce Power\u0027s 3,000 workers live in or near Kincardine, population 12,000. Still, nuclear power is not without critics in Ontario, and protests could grow as the planning process moves forward. A recent report by the Ontario Clean Air Alliance, an environmental group, concluded that the Manley committee\u0027s findings were based on unreliable assumptions. In an interview, the group\u0027s chairman, Jack Gibbons, rated the chances that a new nuclear station would be built in the province as \u0027\u0027extremely low,\u0027\u0027 because the province\u0027s needs could be met by cheaper and more reliable power sources, like natural gas and hydro and wind power and by conservation. Besides, said Frank de Jong, chairman of the Green Party of Ontario, \u0027\u0027people are still not convinced of the safety of nuclear power.\u0027\u0027","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9F06E0D61639F93BA25755C0A9629C8B63","date":"Jun 18, 2004 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":2081219330,"title":"Report Calls Mistrust a Threat to Atom Power","body":"Although the world now relies on nuclear power plants for 15 percent of its electricity, popular mistrust could bring a virtual end to the nuclear age early in the next century, according to a report published today by the Worldwatch Institute, a research organization.

It concluded that public distrust of nuclear power technology did not begin with the Chernobyl reactor accident. \u0027\u0027The accident was simply the worst of a series of developments that had already disenchanted many people,\u0027\u0027 the report said. \u0027\u0027If Chernobyl is compared with a heart attack, it is clear that the ailment struck a patient already afflicted with cancer.\u0027\u0027 In a survey of developments outside the United States, the study said that governments in power had approved the abandonment of nuclear programs in Sweden, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and the Philippines and had canceled or delayed proposed nuclear construction projects in Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Spain.

The footage was released by the Energoatom State Company. Credit Credit... Energoatom State Company KYIV, Ukraine — A Russian missile exploded near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant just after midnight on Monday and forced a shutdown at a hydroelectric station, Ukrainian officials said, in the latest attack by Moscow on critical infrastructure in Ukraine. A missile exploded less than 1,000 feet from the nuclear plant’s reactors and caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station in the industrial zone that surrounds the nuclear complex. There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the nuclear power plant, which remained fully operational, the company said. No casualties were immediately reported. The South Ukraine plant, Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear power station, is some 300 miles west of the larger Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russian forces and has come under repeated shelling. Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, said on Monday that “the Russian army launched a missile attack on the industrial zone of the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant” at 12:20 a.m, causing “a powerful explosion” about 1,000 feet from the reactors. Its shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the nuclear plant, according to the company, which released security camera footage that showed a massive fireball lighting up the night sky over the site. The blast forced the shutdown of one of the hydroelectric plant’s hydraulic units, causing partial power outages in the area. The nuclear plant, near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv region, is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, which includes the hydroelectric plant and one other power station. It lies more than 100 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv and far from any frontline fighting. The strike revived concerns about the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants as Russia steps up attacks aimed at degrading critical energy infrastructure. Before the war, 15 working reactors at four nuclear power plants produced more than half of Ukraine’s electricity, the second highest share among European nations after France. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war but is operated by Ukrainian engineers — appears to have stabilized in recent days after the plant resumed receiving electricity from the country’s power grid on Friday. But its reactors have all been shut down as a safety measure after Energoatom determined that it was too risky to keep them running as fighting continued nearby. The Zaporizhzhia plant, when it was fully operational, supplied about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia’s assaults on Ukraine’s power infrastructure have continued as its campaign on the battlefield falters. After its forces were driven out of northeastern Ukraine just over a week ago, the Kremlin launched missile strikes on a major heat and power plant in Kharkiv, briefly plunging the region into blackout. Ukrainian officials have said they can still produce enough energy to meet the nation’s needs this winter, but damage to critical infrastructure in towns and cities will make it difficult to transmit electricity to hundreds of thousands of consumers. Those living in territory recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces, and in other parts of the country hit hard by fighting, have been urged to evacuate or not to return home until the fighting is over. And for the estimated 1.2 million people living in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces, access to electricity is unclear. In some places, heating, water and power infrastructure have been destroyed or badly damaged. Blackouts are frequently reported in parts of occupied southern Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow’s strikes on energy infrastructure were intended to make Ukrainians suffer as temperatures drop, and to prevent Kyiv from exporting energy to other parts of Europe, where sanctions against Russian energy have contributed to soaring gas and electricity bills, creating havoc for consumers and businesses. “Russia is trying to prevent us from using Ukraine’s capabilities to stabilize the situation in Europe,” he said last week. “Our ability to export electricity is something that Russia is very afraid of right now.

CITING SAFETY, TO SHUT DOWN NUCLEAR PLANT","body":"The Tennessee Valley Authority, citing concern over key emergency safety equipment, announced today that it would shut down the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant indefinitely. The shutdown will leave the Federal power agency without nuclear-generated electricity. The authority has already closed another nuclear plant and has delayed seeking a license for its third because of safety problems. \u0027\u0027I view this action as consistent with T.V.A.\u0027s safety-first operating policy and I have so informed the T.V.A. board today,\u0027\u0027 said Hugh G. Parris, the authority\u0027s nuclear chief. Plant officials have begun shutting down Unit 2 at the plant outside Chattanooga and both units should be shut down by Friday afternoon, he said. Mr. Parris, who took over the authority\u0027s nuclear program last month, said an independent review of the agency\u0027s program on \u0027\u0027environmental qualification of equipment\u0027\u0027 had raised questions about whether certain safety equipment, such as pump motors, electrical valve operators and limit switches, would work in an emergency. Lack of Confidence Cited \u0027\u0027There were enough problems identified that we no longer have the degree of confidence that we feel we must have that these key safety systems would work if called on,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Parris said. The review by Westec Services Inc., a consulting concern in Philadelphia, found that the authority did not have enough documentation to prove the equipment would work if exposed to temperatures, pressure and radiation caused by an accident, Mr. Parris said. \u0027\u0027At this time, we do not know how long the Sequoyah units will be shut down,\u0027\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027That will be determined as we review our program and make the necessary changes.\u0027\u0027 There have been two leaks of radioactive water at the plant in the last month. Eleven workers received what the T.V.A. said was minor contamination July 30 when about 600 gallons of water used to cool the reactor leaked from a line in Unit 2. A similar but smaller leak occurred Aug. 11 in Unit 1. Tests indicated vibrations caused both leaks, the authority said today. In March, the power authority\u0027s board ordered the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant near Athens, Ala., shut down indefinitely after questions were raised about the safety of its operation. Fines of Over $1 Million The T.V.A. has been fined more than $1 million by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 1980 for safety violations at its nuclear plants. The biggest part of that amount has been for violations at Browns Ferry, a three-reactor plant opened in 1974. The power agency, which also gets electricity from 12 coal-fired plants and 29 hydroelectric plants, serves 7.8 million people in Tennessee and parts of Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. Earlier this summer, the power authority dropped plans to immediately seek a low-power operating license for its Watts Bar nuclear plant near Spring City, Tenn., after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asked it to examine questions raised by employees about the plant\u0027s safety. The power authority hired a Kansas concern, the Quality Technology Corporation, to interview the plant\u0027s 4,800 workers. So far, 22 of 38 complaints about safety at Watts Bar have been verified and must be corrected, the power authority said. Because of its shortage of nuclear power generation, along with the dry weather, the power authority\u0027s board is expected to approve a 6.9 percent rate increase at its meeting Aug. 29. ---- $100,000 Fine Proposed MIAMI, Aug. 21 (AP) - The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recommended a $100,000 fine of the Florida Power and Light Company for what an official called a potentially dangerous situation at the Turkey Point nuclear power plant.

Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters All three nuclear power plants under Ukrainian control are back online and will soon be producing energy at normal capacity, the head of the national energy utility said on Friday, two days after Russian missile strikes that forced utility crews to scramble to stabilize the country’s crippled energy grid and raised further concerns about the nuclear perils of the war. Ukraine typically relies on nuclear power for more than half of its energy, an uncommonly high rate of dependence. The Russian attacks on Wednesday triggered emergency protections at the three plants and required a halt to production. “Now the energy system is fully integrated; all regions are connected,” said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive officer of Ukrenergo, the national utility. He added that utility crews are prepared to react to further Russian attacks, but urged consumers to save electricity. Wednesday marked the first time in the 40-year history of the country’s nuclear power industry that all operating nuclear facilities were shut down and had to rely on emergency diesel generators, officials said For months, attacks in and around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left engineers racing from one crisis to the next as it has repeatedly been disconnected from the national energy grid. External power was restored on Thursday morning at the plant a day after it was lost, according to the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has had inspectors at the facility since early September. That plant, Europe’s largest, has been offline since September but still needs electricity to keep cooling equipment running around the clock and ward off a nuclear meltdown. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Grossi, the U.N. agency’s director general, said on Thursday. “This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning.” The agency has started providing assistance at Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants after it was requested by Kyiv, Mr. Grossi said. “We must do everything to prevent a nuclear accident at any of these facilities, which would only add to the terrible suffering we are already witnessing in Ukraine,” he said. Snow and freezing rain worsened the plight of millions of Ukrainians who remained without power Thursday evening. Officials said electricity had been restored to meet about half of the country’s consumption needs as of 7 p.m. The city government in Kyiv, the capital, said on Friday morning that water had been fully restored but that half of the city’s housing stock was still in emergency power outage mode. A significant number of thermal and hydroelectric plants were back in operation, Ukrenergo said in its Telegram channel. Authorities were prioritizing restoring energy to critical infrastructure — gas distribution, sewage treatment, and hospitals — before household consumers, the utility said. “Energy workers, utility workers, business — everyone is doing their part to give light again,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in his nightly address. “This is truly a nationwide task — Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/25/world/russia-ukraine-war-news/shelling-kills-7-in-kherson-ukrainian-officials-say","date":"Nov 25, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":381757751,"title":"Why We Still Need Nuclear","body":"Knoxville, Tenn. IN two weeks the Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest public power producer, will decide whether to complete construction of a long-deferred generating unit at the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, in northeast Alabama. If we proceed, Bellefonte 1 would become the T.V.A.’s third nuclear unit brought into service in the 21st century. This is, understandably, a controversial issue. Why are we thinking of expanding our fleet of nuclear plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster? After all, some countries seem to be going the other way: Germany and others are planning to cut back or eliminate their nuclear power facilities altogether. Indeed, whether the Bellefonte project moves forward or not, the T.V.A. is committed to demonstrating that a methodical, safety-driven approach to nuclear development works. Along with the possibility of restarting work at Bellefonte, in recent years we have upgraded our Browns Ferry 1 reactor, also in Alabama, and we are completing a second reactor at our Watts Bar plant, in eastern Tennessee. The reason for the commitment is simple: for all the recent news, nuclear is still our best choice for producing large amounts of round-the-clock, reliable electricity that is affordable, safe and clean. The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal corporation, was formed in 1933 to rescue a large section of the Depression-ravaged South along the Tennessee River watershed. The power was originally provided by dams, but over the years they were supplemented with coal, gas and nuclear plants. Today some 9 million people get their power from us. The Tennessee Valley Authority has operated nuclear plants for three decades, but our program was hindered, as many energy providers were, by safety concerns and a public backlash against nuclear generation in the 1980s. Our response, however, was not to abandon nuclear energy. Instead, we revamped our program and adopted a more conservative, disciplined approach to both operations and construction. In a departure from the 1970s, when we were building 17 nuclear units at once, today we allow only one unit to be in any single stage of development at a time. We believe that nuclear power, developed properly, is not only a promising option, but the best available. Our forecasts for the region’s energy demands by the end of the decade show we will need more base-load electricity — or continuous minimum power — something nuclear plants excel at providing. Fortunately, we have a ready option at hand. Construction at Bellefonte began in 1974, but projections of stagnant energy demand led the T.V.A. to stop work in 1988. Because Bellefonte was never operated and was well preserved after being deferred, much of the plant is in excellent condition today. Moreover, if approved, the plant would undergo a six- to eight-year, $5-billion makeover. Major components — like the two large steam generators — critical wiring, instrumentation and thousands of other pieces of equipment would be replaced. When completed, the plant that some label a dinosaur would be among the most modern, thoroughly inspected and safest nuclear facilities in the nation. Nevertheless, critics have rightly asked, why not simply bypass nuclear power and rely on more wind, solar, gas and energy efficiency? In fact, the T.V.A. is adding power from all of those sources in record amounts. But none can produce sufficiently large volumes of base-load electricity as consistently and affordably as nuclear power can. No energy source is perfect. But the risks associated with nuclear power are well understood and — with the proper emphasis on safety — they are entirely manageable. Fukushima taught us that we must be prepared for what was once considered almost unimaginable, and we are incorporating the lessons of that disaster into our everyday operations. At the Tennessee Valley Authority, our strategy for meeting the electricity challenges of the future is a balanced portfolio of energy production that relies somewhat less on coal, and more on energy efficiency, gas, renewable and nuclear power. If cost, reliability and cleaner air are important, nuclear energy must be part of the mix.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/opinion/nuclear-plant-in-alabama-is-due-for-decision.html","date":"Jul 30, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-897031840,"title":"Germany, Facing Energy Crisis, Gives Nuclear Another Look","body":"“This is painful for all of us,” she said, as she worked in her darkened office to save electricity. “But we are also under the shadow of this war in Ukraine.” That admission is probably harder for politicians like Ms. Steinberger than those from any other German party: She is from the Greens who now share power with Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats in Berlin. The Greens have their roots not only in Germany’s environmental movement, but also in its grass-roots antinuclear protests, where the police clashed with activists, who sometimes chained themselves to the gates of nuclear plants. Annalena Baerbock, the Green foreign minister, grew up going to such demonstrations, where human chains were formed in protest of nuclear plants. Even as many in her party begin to accept what looks inevitable, Ms. Baerbock insisted on Wednesday that she still believed an extension of nuclear power was “not an option.” It is an irony of politics that it was Ms. Merkel who became the poster child for Germany’s “nuclear exit.” Her Christian Democrats were long proponents of nuclear power, and her government fought to extend the life of nuclear power after a previous left-leaning government sought to shut it down. She defended that move by arguing atomic energy was the “bridging technology” paving the way toward a renewable energy system in Germany — the same language her party later used to defend the shift to gas. But the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011 forced her into a U-turn, after her party faced a catastrophic loss in regional elections to the Greens, who campaigned against nuclear power. Germans, long split over nuclear issues, had shifted against atomic energy, and Ms. Merkel soon took seven of Germany’s 17 nuclear power plants offline.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/world/europe/europe-energy-germany-nuclear.html","date":"Aug 5, 2022 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":590850944,"title":"Nukes Are Green","body":"If there was one thing that used to be crystal clear to any environmentalist, it was that nuclear energy was the deadliest threat this planet faced. That\u0027s why Dick Gregory pledged at a huge anti-nuke demonstration in 1979 that he would eat no solid food until all nuclear plants in the U.S. were shut down. Mr. Gregory may be getting hungry. But it\u0027s time for the rest of us to drop that hostility to nuclear power. It\u0027s increasingly clear that the biggest environmental threat we face is actually global warming, and that leads to a corollary: nuclear energy is green. Nuclear power, in contrast with other sources, produces no greenhouse gases. So President Bush\u0027s overall environmental policy gives me the shivers, but he\u0027s right to push ahead for nuclear energy. There haven\u0027t been any successful orders for new nuclear plants since 1973, but several proposals for new plants are now moving ahead -- and that\u0027s good for the world we live in. Global energy demand will rise 60 percent over the next 25 years, according to the International Energy Agency, and nuclear power is the cleanest and best bet to fill that gap. Solar power is a disappointment, still accounting for only about one-fifth of 1 percent of the nation\u0027s electricity and costing about five times as much as other sources. Wind is promising, for its costs have fallen 80 percent, but it suffers from one big problem: wind doesn\u0027t blow all the time. It\u0027s difficult to rely upon a source that comes and goes. In contrast, nuclear energy already makes up 20 percent of America\u0027s power, not to mention 75 percent of France\u0027s. A sensible energy plan must encourage conservation -- far more than Mr. Bush\u0027s plans do -- and promote things like hybrid vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells. But for now, nuclear power is the only source that doesn\u0027t contribute to global warming and that can quickly become a mainstay of the grid. Is it safe? No, not entirely. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl demonstrated that, and there are also risks from terrorist attacks. Then again, the world now has a half-century of experience with nuclear power plants, 440 of them around the world, and they have proved safer so far than the alternatives. America\u0027s biggest power source is now coal, which kills about 25,000 people a year through soot in the air. To put it another way, nuclear energy seems much safer than our dependency on coal, which kills more than 60 people every day. Moreover, nuclear technology has become far safer over the years. The future may belong to pebble-bed reactors, a new design that promises to be both highly efficient and incapable of a meltdown. Radioactive wastes are a challenge. But burdening future generations with nuclear wastes in deep shafts is probably more reasonable than burdening them with a warmer world in which Manhattan is submerged under 20 feet of water. Right now, the only significant source of electricity in the U.S. that does not involve carbon emissions is hydropower. But salmon runs have declined so much that we should be ripping out dams, not adding more. What killed nuclear power in the past was cold economics. Major studies at M.I.T. and elsewhere show that nuclear power is still a bit more expensive than new coal or natural gas plants, but in the same ballpark if fossil fuel prices rise. And if a $200-per-ton tax was imposed on carbon emissions, nuclear energy would become cheaper than coal from new plants. So it\u0027s time to welcome nuclear energy as green . Indeed, some environmentalists are already climbing onboard. For example, the National Commission on Energy Policy, a privately financed effort involving environmentalists, academics and industry representatives, issued a report in December that favors new nuclear plants. One of the most eloquent advocates of nuclear energy is James Lovelock, the British scientist who created the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is, in effect, a self-regulating organism. \u0027\u0027I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Lovelock wrote last year, adding: \u0027\u0027Every year that we continue burning carbon makes it worse for our descendents. Only one immediately available source does not cause global warming, and that is nuclear energy.\u0027\u0027 Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9402EFDC143EF93AA35757C0A9639C8B63","date":"Apr 9, 2005 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":901164959,"title":"Market Place; Nuclear Power Alternatives","body":"THE Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster may have resulted in an indirect benefit for companies that provide other forms of energy. Analysts say that producers of gas, coal and oil may have had their future earnings and equity appreciation prospects brightened as the energy industry intensifies its quest for alternatives to nuclear power. To some experts the effects on the energy industry from the Russian disaster can be equated with what happened following the Arab oil embargo in 1973, when rising oil costs spurred shifts to such traditional energy sources as coal and natural gas. Other analysts, however, are more cautious. Although companies that took the nuclear route paid the highest dividends of any energy group, this has not halted their slide from favor since the accident in 1979 involving the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in this country. \u0027\u0027In the wake of Chernobyl many people who own nuclear stocks have either sold them or will sell them and reinvest some of that capital into a logical extension - natural gas and coal,\u0027\u0027 said John Slatter, utilities analyst at Prescott, Ball \u0026 Turben in Cleveland. In light of the current situation, Mr. Slatter says he likes the Delmarva Power and Light Company, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, the Duke Power Company and the Northern States Power Company. While Baltimore Gas and Duke Power have nuclear plants, those facilities have been completed and therefore do not face the problems of cost overruns, delays, rules and regulations pertaining to construction of new nuclear plants, or public opposition to completion of plants. \u0027\u0027If a shift away from nuclear energy to other energy sources does in fact constitute a trend, there will be upward price pressure on nonnuclear energy sources such as coal, gas and oil,\u0027\u0027 said Richard Schmidt, director of research of the Advest Group Inc. in Hartford. \u0027\u0027I would be very con-cerned about the stocks of companies that are involved in major nuclear construction projects.\u0027\u0027 Mr. Schmidt says his firm likes electrical utilities that have no significant nuclear exposures, such as Allegheny Power System Inc. and the Midwest Energy Company; gas concerns such as the Bay State Gas Company and the Providence Energy Corporation; the Mobil and Exxon Corporations among the oils, which may experience some firming of prices, and, among the coals, the Pittston Company, on the assumption that some utilities might choose limited coal use. \u0027\u0027Natural gas local distribution companies are safe havens for income-conscious investors,\u0027\u0027 said Barry Sahgal, energy analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann \u0026 Company. He said that adequate supplies of gas, improved responsiveness to competitive pricing, a better regulatory environment, stronger balance sheets, predictable cash flows and prospects for dividend growth most likely would continue to attract investor interest in the local distribution group. Mr. Sahgal said his investment recommendations would include the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Connecticut Energy Corporation and the Public Service Company of North Carolina. \u0027\u0027Investors should view the Chernobyl disaster as an opportunity to invest in quality companies with strong fundamentals where they might realize a longer-term benefit rather than instant gratification,\u0027\u0027 Mr. Saghal added. While most of the focus away from nuclear power has been on traditional energy, more exotic forms are also drawing interest. \u0027\u0027Since the oil embargo, a vigorous industry of independent power producers has emerged,\u0027\u0027 said Donald Marier, publisher of Alternative Sources of Energy, the magazine of the independent power production industry. \u0027\u0027The Chernobyl disaster should cause investors to take a closer look at the independents who often use renewable energy sources.\u0027\u0027 Mr. Marier said the technologies currently being developed or improved upon include renewable sources such as geothermal energy, solar energy and water and wind power. Mr. Marier said independents that might possibly benefit from the continued swing away from nuclear energy include the Catalyst Energy Development Corporation and Cogenic Energy Systems in cogeneration; Ultrasystems Inc. in wood-fired cogeneration systems, and Energy Conversion Devices and the Chronar Corporation in solar cell energy. A cogeneration plant produces steam for heating or cooling and also produces electricity. Some cogeneration plants are operated from fossil fuels while others are fired from solid wastes or from biomass, wood or agricultural wastes. Analysts see continuing growth opportunities for independent power producers, particularly in \u0027\u0027rate-shock\u0027\u0027 areas where consumers face large electrical rate increases with nuclear power plants coming into the rate base.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/09/business/market-place-nuclear-power-alternatives.html","date":"May 9, 1986 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1595711574,"title":"Fire Damages a Nuclear Plant in Maine","body":"A nuclear power plant in Maine was crippled by explosions and a fire Monday night, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today, but it said no radiation was released into the air. The commission and officials of the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset said the flames, heat and firefighting efforts did no damage to the reactor or other nuclear parts of the plant. Automatic firefighting equipment in the nuclear part was not needed, they said. The fire began at 6:32 P.M. in the non-nuclear part of the plant, plant officials and the commission said. Its cause has not been determined, but employees told Federal investigators they heard what appeared to be explosions before the fire broke out near the plant\u0027s main electrical transformer and beneath the turbine generator. The fire occurred 100 feet to 200 feet from the containment building that encases the plant\u0027s nuclear reactor within a 4 1/2-foot-thick wall of concrete reinforced with steel. Plant officials said the fire burned for four hours and was fed by hydrogen used to cool the generator. It was hot enough to cause the main electrical transformer to buckle, rupturing seals, and allowing thousands of gallons of lubricating oil to spill into a catchment area outside the plant. At least 200 gallons of oil leaked into the Back River, plant officials said. No one was injured, plant officials said today in a prepared statement. System Worked, Officials Say Richard H. Wessman, project director in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, stressed that although the fire appeared to be severe such accidents have occurred before in nuclear and conventionally powered electrical generating plants. The automatic shutdown system, as intended, shut down the reactor without incident immediately after the fire broke out, he said. At a news conference this afternoon, Maine Yankee\u0027s president, Charles Frizzle, also said the fire could have happened at any power plant. \"I don\u0027t want to downgrade the seriousness of the event,\" Mr. Frizzle said, \"but it\u0027s not a nuclear event. From my perspective, this should not reflect negatively on the use of nuclear power. It has nothing to do with nuclear power.\" Crucial Time for Industry The accident occurred during a politically sensitive period for the American nuclear power industry. On Thursday, the regulatory commission is to rule on a staff recommendation to restart a reactor at Browns Ferry, a troubled nuclear plant near Athens, Ala., that has been shut for safety reasons since March 1985. John Moulton, a spokesman for the Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville, Tenn., the plant\u0027s owner, said the accident in Maine should not effect the decision to restart Browns Ferry. Next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is scheduled to vote on a measure that would streamline the licensing procedures for nuclear power plants. The changes, proposed by the committee\u0027s chairman, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, would make licensing a one-step process and eliminate almost every stage that enables the public to make comments. The Bush Administration has also staked a sizeable portion of its national energy strategy on reviving nuclear power. It says the 110 American nuclear power plants are safe and are far less polluting than electric power plants fueled by coal or oil. The Administration has also financed studies through the Department of Energy to design a new generation of nuclear reactors that would be largely incapable of melting down. But critics of the technology say that splitting atoms to gain energy is inherently dangerous and insist that the mining, milling, and processing of uranium for nuclear fuel is one of the dirtiest and most dangerous industries in the United States. Moreover, they say, the Administration has yet to find a permanent solution for safe disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants. The regulatory commission reported today that unplanned incidents occurred Monday and last week at two other nuclear plants in New England, forcing their shutdown. A leak of hot water in the nuclear containment vessel at the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Mass. prompted its shutdown on Monday, the commission said, but no radiation was released. The plant\u0027s owner, the Boston Edison Company, had been aware of the leak for weeks before the shutdown and planned to repair it during a planned shutdown beginning May 4. A worsening of the leak caused the utility to take the reactor out of service early. The other incident occurred April 24, when the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant five miles south of Brattleboro suddenly lost its primary source of power. The interruption of power prompted the plant to turn on its independent electrical generators and led to an unplanned shutdown of the reactor. The incident may have caused when an employee mistakenly tripped a switch that caused all power into the plant to be cut off, the regulatory commission said. Its investigators are studying the incident. For more than a decade Maine Yankee, which sits along the coast about 40 miles northeast of Portland, has been at the center of a struggle between environmentalists and the nuclear power industry. Critics tried three times from 1980 to 1987 to shut it down with voter referendums on statewide ballots; each time about 60 percent of voters favored keeping the plant open. Leaders of the Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee, an antinuclear group based in Portland that has led the campaign to close Maine Yankee, said today that since last July the plant has been shut down nine times because of unexpected problems. \"We feel very strongly that what we\u0027re dealing with is an aging nuclear reactor that is beginning to show its age,\" Thomas Coffin, a spokesman for the group, said. Residents of Wiscasset say the plant has been a good neighbor, a good employer and a supplier of about 90 percent of the local tax base. Of the plant\u0027s 420 employees, many come from Wiscasset, which has a population of about 3,400. \"Until they come up with a better alternative, I support its being here,\" said Robert Rogers, who lives less than a mile from the plant. \"It does pump quite a lot of money into the economy here, and they\u0027ve had a real good safety record.\" The regulatory commission said that in the last several years the owners of Maine Yankee have received the Government\u0027s highest rating for operating the plant. Maine Yankee, which began operating commercially in 1972, is owned by 10 utility companies in New England, with the Central Maine Power Company having the largest share. The 825-megawatt plant was designed Combustion Engineering Inc., a nationally known engineering company in Stamford, Conn. It provides low-cost electric power to about one-fourth of the homes and businesses in Maine. Plant executives said today it was too early to determine when Maine Yankee would return to service. The generator and transformers sustained extensive damage, and the plant could be shut down for weeks if not months. But the shutdown will not cause a shortage in power, they said, because hydroelectric power is plentiful this time of year. The regulatory commission sent a team of experts Monday night to investigate the causes of the explosion and fire and determine how well the plant\u0027s operators and its automatic systems responded.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9D0CE2DC113AF932A35756C0A967958260","date":"May 1, 1991 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-417788711,"title":"Energy-Hungry, Asia Embraces Nuclear Power","body":"IT\u0027S difficult to imagine the hulking towers of a nuclear power plant rising up from the emerald-green rice paddies of Vietnam, a nation so poor that most people still depend on cooking over an open fire and lighting their homes with oil lamps. But this month, the Vietnamese Government announced that it was considering a proposal from South Korea to build two nuclear reactors here at a cost of $3 billion. Vietnam is one of the few Asian nations blessed by large deposits of fossil fuel -- it has huge tracts of offshore oil -- but its leaders are eager not to be left behind in the nuclear-power binge sweeping Asia. Nuclear power is an industry in crisis in the West, the result both of the panic produced by the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and of the multi-billion-dollar cost overruns that have plagued nuclear-energy projects throughout Europe and the United States. No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States since 1979. But if the nuclear-energy genie is dying in the West, he is being reborn in Asia. The booming, fuel-hungry nations across the region are ordering and building nuclear plants at a rate not seen in decades. Fail-Safe? There are already 115 commercial and research reactors in operation in East Asia, most in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. In the next decade, dozens of new reactors are expected to built across the continent at a cost of more than $100 billion. Asian leaders say they have no choice but to develop nuclear power given the explosive rate at which the demand for energy is growing. The International Atomic Energy Agency has predicted that power demands in Asia will triple by 2015. But while reactors may power Asia\u0027s thriving economies into the next century, they also pose problems of safety and cost that the West has been tangling with unsuccessfully throughout the atomic age. It is a subject now under scrutiny at the United Nations, where diplomats opened talks last week on extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 25-year-old treaty, which is about to expire, was designed to limit the spread of nuclear arms in part by allowing inspection of power plants to verify that atomic material is not diverted to weapons use. But evidence from North Korea has shown that a determined government could use civil nuclear programs as a cover for weapons development, and the spread of nuclear power in Asia has raised new concerns about proliferation. Anti-nuclear advocates are dismayed. \"It\u0027s the first world dumping old, dangerous technology on the developing world,\" said Jean McSorley, who directs anti-nuclear campaigns in Asia for Greenpeace. \"We\u0027re encouraging them to repeat the same mistakes that we made.\" Environmental groups say they take little solace from the fact that most of the plants now being built in Asia are of Western design, and that they incorporate hard-earned lessons about safety. They have called on Asian nations to shun atomic energy in favor of conservation and the use of safer energy sources. Solar energy, they say, would be a natural choice in much of sun-baked Southeast Asia. No Asian nation has embraced nuclear energy more enthusiastically than China, which opened its first commercial complex only last year but has plans for 30 more reactors. Last month, it announced a shifting in national energy policy to encourage the development of nuclear power over hydropower and thermal energy, the priorities until now. \"We are energetically developing nuclear power,\" said Yao Qiming, a government energy official. \"It is our future.\" Western companies are rushing in with proposals to build reactors. In January, China awarded three French firms a $3 billion contract to build two nuclear plants in Guangdong Province. Few in the industry were surprised when the chairmen of Westinghouse and General Electric, both of which design or build nuclear plants, showed up in Beijing last year for talks. \"The energy growth in Asia is just astonishing, and their move to nuclear energy shows that the nations of Asia understand the value of having a mix of energy resources -- and the value of nuclear energy,\" said Angie McBrien of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group. But if the Clinton Administration is eager to see American companies benefit from the development of atomic power in China, it has been dismayed by what has gone on in North Korea, the nation that more than any in Asia had proved the dangers of the unrestrained nuclear development. Temptations Until last year, North Korea appeared bent on using spent fuel from a reactor to make weapons-grade plutonium. Under an agreement with the United States, the plant is to be shut down in return for safer reactors designed to limit the risk of diversion. Negotiations to implement that agreement have been on-again, off-again. At the same time, some critics fear that other Asian countries that until now have disavowed ambitions for nuclear arms may be tempted to reconsider. \"My worst-case scenario is that every country in the region would get a couple of reactors with the idea that they want to keep their military options open,\" said Ms. McSorley of Greenpeace. The options are wide open in India and Pakistan, both of which have diverted nuclear material from power plants to the making of weapons that they might use against one another. Unlike most Asian nations, neither India nor Pakistan has signed the non-proliferation pact. In Southeast Asia, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are all in varying stages of nuclear development. Indonesia is about to take bids for its first nuclear plant. The governments of South Korea, Japan and Taiwan already support some of the world\u0027s most sophisticated nuclear-power programs. In South Korea, nuclear power provides more than 40 percent of all the electricity generated in the country; in Japan and Taiwan, the figure is about 30 percent. The Japanese Government has proposed the construction of at least 15 new nuclear reactors by 2010, and it is now pursuing the commercial use of fast-breeder reactors, which use plutonium for fuel. The rush to nuclear power would not be so worrying if Asian leaders could guarantee that they would remain at peace. Since the Vietnam War, Asians have enjoyed a remarkable neighborliness. One reason for the region\u0027s economic success is that most governments have not been forced to spend a crippling portion of their budget on arms. But military historians say it is only a matter of time before the collegiality of the region breaks down. In just the last few weeks, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have all raised the threat of military action over the potentially oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, after China built a military-style platform atop a tiny reef. Asian diplomats have been alarmed by the recent dispute between two old strategic allies, the Philippines and Singapore, which came close to a diplomatic split over the execution in Singapore of a Filipino maid. Tension Worried, Japanese scholars and nuclear experts have proposed a pan-Asian agreement to police recycling of nuclear material and prevent military diversions. Diplomats in the region have embraced the idea. Proponents say an accord may be essential as Asian nations are forced to cooperate in waste disposal. Some land-starved countries are already having trouble disposing of spent fuel -- South Korea expects to fill all its storage sites in a decade.

Ebinger correctly sounds the alarm over the public\u0027s attitude toward the drop in oil prices. We cannot stop planning for our energy future because the crunch at the gas pump has been temporarily eased. And indeed, the Reagan Administration has turned its back on America\u0027s energy future by cutting programs to develop \u0027\u0027renewable\u0027\u0027 technologies and, more recently, by the President\u0027s veto of legislation requiring new appliances to be more energy-efficient. However, while Mr. Ebinger correctly characterizes current attitudes toward our future energy needs, his solution misses the mark. He says the Arab oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979 taught us to rely more heavily on our own energy sources -especially coal and uranium. However, conservation and energy-efficiency improvements, not nuclear power, proved the most appropriate mechanism for reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Since 1978, savings from improved energy efficiency have in effect supplied 23 percent of U.S. energy. Renewable energy sources contributed more new energy over the last decade than coal and nuclear energy combined, and currently provide twice as much primary energy as nuclear power. Furthermore, while nuclear power creates electricity, more than 90 percent of our oil is used for industry, automobiles and home heating. Those crucial functions cannot be subsumed by nuclear power. Mr. Ebinger cites the Chernobyl accident as a major contributor to nuclear industry woes. In reality, Chernobyl only slightly exacerbated the growing public dissatisfaction with nuclear power. Analysis of polling data shows a steady decline in public support for new nuclear construction. In 1975, 65 percent of the public supported building more nuclear power plants. But in early 1986, before the Chernobyl accident, nearly 70 percent opposed new nuclear plants. Much in the last 11 years has eroded public support - the Three Mile Island accident, the economic disaster of the Washington Public Power Supply System and thousands of \u0027\u0027incidents and accidents\u0027\u0027 at plants each year. Besides the Chernobyl accident, 1986 was marked by cost overruns and significant safety incidents. For example, last December, during preoperational testing, valve malfunctions were discovered at the Nine Mile II plant in upstate New York. The cost to correct the problem is estimated at $240 million, bringing the total cost of the plant, originally set at $316 million, to $6 billion. Public and political support for nuclear power has eroded not because of the accident in the Ukraine but because of the industry\u0027s economic and safety record here at home. By perpetuating the myth that nuclear power is a viable alternative to oil imports, Mr. Ebinger does a disservice. The real lesson of the energy crisis of the 70\u0027s is that energy efficiency, not nuclear power, is the key to America\u0027s energy future.

However, I would like to present the other side of the public relations ploys and preachments of the United States Council of Energy Awareness on \u0027\u0027nuclear electricity and energy independence.\u0027\u0027 Yes, on the global scale, nuclear power generation is growing. According to a recent study by the International Atomic Energy Agency, over the last 15 years, the annual growth rates in the fraction of electricity produced by nuclear have been 15 percent for industrialized countries, 28 percent for developing countries. Only in 1988, 14 new nuclear power reactors in eight countries were commissioned, bringing the world\u0027s total of operating plants to 429. At the end of 1988, 26 countries had nuclear power plants, with 105 more under construction. The increasing need for electrical energy, lack of local sources of energy, the specter of worrisome balance of payments and foreign debt caused by imported energy and, finally, fear of burning more fossil fuel and the resultant greenhouse effect will bring proliferation of nuclear power plants, at least for the near future. However, this trend could lead from the frying pan of the greenhouse effect into the fire of disastrous nuclear accidents, like the one at Chernobyl, near Kiev in the Soviet Union. The Chernobyl accident demonstrated for the first time that the effects of any such nuclear accident would not be localized, but would spill over into neighboring countries and have global consequences. The radioactive fallout from Chernobyl contaminated the milk supply of Sicily, 1,000 miles away. It is not simply, as the Council on Energy Awareness argues, design, small scale or such technology as automation that make a nuclear power plant safer. Technological systems accidents are caused by the way the engineered and human components interact. The safety of large-scale systems demands an approach to design and operation as attentive to human as to technical elements. To revive the atom and have safe nuclear plants, we need much more commitment, communication and cooperation among government and international agencies, plant manufacturers, utilities, unions and research communities. We need dedication by all parties, not rhetoric or public relations.

The country is expected to outline a new energy policy, prompted by the disaster at Fukushima, and one option the government has explored would phase out all nuclear power by 2030. Public anxiety over nuclear safety has helped keep all but two of Japan’s 50 remaining reactors offline, and the country’s nascent anti-nuclear movement has demanded an even more immediate shutdown. But energy prices would soar, the country would become dangerously dependent on Middle Eastern oil and its greenhouse gas emissions would surge if it went nuclear-free — especially if it did so immediately, said Naomi Hirose, president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company. And without a swift restart of the remaining reactors, the company’s finances, already crippled by compensation claims after the Fukushima disaster, would worsen further, he warned. “We understand that local residents might ask whether they are really all right with letting us operate nuclear reactors again after the accident,” he said. “But zero nuclear is a very dangerous option. We need to step back and think of the wider consequences of giving up nuclear power.” Tokyo Electric has not given up on winning local residents’ approval to reopen the two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant that survived the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, as well as four other reactors 16 kilometers (10 miles) away, Mr. Hirose said Wednesday. More urgent is the restarting of a third nuclear plant run by Tokyo Electric at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, about 124 miles from the Fukushima site on Japan’s northwest coast, he said. The governor of Niigata Prefecture, where that plant is situated, remains opposed to restarting any of the seven reactors. Mr. Hirose is part of a chorus of voices urging Japan not to turn away from nuclear power. Japan’s largest and most influential business lobby, the Nippon Keidanren, has also warned that a nuclear shutdown would create an energy shortage that would cripple economic growth. Japan once relied on nuclear power for about 30 percent of its electricity. Nuclear opponents have argued that Japan can make up for lost capacity by temporarily shifting to fossil fuels while the country races to expand alternative sources of energy. Japan made it through a sweltering summer with just two reactors running, they say — proof that the nation could do away with reactors altogether. But Mr. Hirose said power companies had averted blackouts this summer only by firing up old oil and natural gas stations and by importing fuel and generators at great cost. He said energy sources like solar and wind were still unreliable and would be feasible only with backup energy from conventional power stations like those that Tokyo Electric operates. “When people think of these new energy sources, they only think of best-case scenarios,” Mr. Hirose said. “But we have a responsibility to provide a cheap and stable source of power. We have to be realistic.” The company’s mission is to make sure that a nuclear accident never happens again, Mr. Hirose said.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/business/global/president-of-tokyo-electric-urges-nuclear-future.html","date":"Sep 5, 2012 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":1810014447,"title":"William S.

By the turn of the century, Soviet officials hope to double - to more than 20 percent - the percentage of electricity generated by nuclear reactors.

To the Editor: Re “ Nuclear Power Can Save the World ,” by Joshua S. Goldstein, Staffan A. Qvist and Steven Pinker (Sunday Review, April 7): Will it take another Chernobyl or Fukushima, possibly in an American city, to quiet the disinformation coming from nuclear activists? What the world needs is energy that is both carbon-free and radiation-free. Those of us who live near a failed nuclear power plant know the truth: Nuclear power is by far the most expensive, the most dangerous, the most unreliable and the most environmentally unfriendly form of energy production. Roger Johnson San Clemente, Calif. To the Editor: The authors write: “Today, renewables work only with fossil-fuel backup .” How am I going to break this news to the batteries that are handily backing up our solar array? As a dry run for hurricane season, I turned off the utility power to our house for a week. We lived our normal life, running the central air-conditioner, charging our electric car, and doing a lot of laundry with the electric washer and dryer. Some days were sunny, some were cloudy, but we never ran out of power. Even our formerly solar-averse utility is starting to replace gas-burning power plants with solar plus battery storage. As George Bernard Shaw noted, “People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it .” Philip K. Stoddard South Miami The writer is the mayor of South Miami. To the Editor: I recently retired after working more than 40 years in the nuclear power industry. I was involved in the design, licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The points made are well articulated and reasonable. Unfortunately, these are the same messages that have been repeated for the past decades. The United States’ nuclear power plant supply chain has been deteriorating for years because of the lack of new reactor orders. What is needed is a national energy policy that designates nuclear power as a strategic energy source. It deserves the same commitment that the Apollo program did, from conception to fulfillment. We just need the will to make it work. Leo Lessard Clinton, Mass. To the Editor: I am surprised the authors downplayed the problem of nuclear waste. “Over time” it becomes less radioactive? That time period can be tens of thousands of years. Also, countries throughout Europe are switching away from nuclear to renewable energy. Still, the authors make an interesting case for nukes. Kevin Dougherty Quebec City To the Editor: I will support nuclear power the day after the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act is repealed. If insurance company actuaries consider nuclear power to be so dangerous that they cannot compute premiums that the industry can afford, then that industry is not economically viable. If the government (i.e., taxpayers) has to cover the industry with catastrophic insurance, then the government should own the reactors and provide nonprofit energy. We were lucky at Three Mile Island. We were minutes away from a complete meltdown that given the plant’s location would have killed thousands and done billions in damage. Investigations of Three Mile Island showed that, like the Deepwater Horizon disaster, extremely dangerous processes cannot be allowed to remain in control of people whose first responsibility is profit or return to shareholders.

Some are building new reactors as fast as they can. They are coming from everywhere in Australia; shirt-sleeved workers from every corner of the continent heading to a remote stretch of the South Australian desert. There is no water, and not much of anything else either. But the Olympic Dam mine is located here. And the mine is hiring. The company currently employs about 700 miners, who have already dug several kilometers of tunnels under the desert. The area is so bone dry that drinking water must be pumped through a system of pipes from a distant spring. Recently, there has even been talk of building a desalination plant. After all, uranium mining requires water -- lots of it -- and Australia wants to remain the world\u0027s second largest supplier after Canada. The explanation for the government\u0027s enthusiasm for nuclear power can be found in a report by nuclear physicist and former IT manger Ziggy Switkowski. As if on cue, he enthuses about the need for more nuclear power plants: Australia must start building reactors so that the first one can be completed in 2020. If a concerted effort is made, another 25 could be online by mid-century. On the one hand, this would help the country improve its poor record of carbon dioxide emissions. On the other, it would allow Australia to tap an almost inexhaustible source of energy; the country possesses more than 38 percent of the world\u0027s accessible uranium reserves. The international atomic energy lobby loves such talk. Almost 21 years after the Chernobyl disaster, and just a couple months after the most recent breakdown at Sweden\u0027s Forsmark reactor last July, the risks associated with nuclear power are largely fading into the background. So too are questions about the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and atomic weapons. The industry, in short, is preparing for a new boom. Plans for more nuclear plants Currently there are 435 atomic reactors generating electricity in 31 countries across the globe. They fill 6.5 percent of the world\u0027s total energy demand and use close to 70,000 tons of enriched uranium per year. Atomic plants produce one-sixth of the total electricity supply -- roughly on par with hydropower. That number may soon rocket upwards. At present, 29 nuclear power plants are under construction and there are concrete plans to build another 64. Another 158 are under consideration. On the other end of the equation, only six are slowly being shut down in preparation for decommissioning. In response to the growing demand, the price for uranium has increased seven-fold since 2002 and now sells for $72 per pound (454 grams). The fact that no final storage place exists for highly radioactive waste is considered to be but a secondary problem. Indeed, the only terminal repository apparently free from political opposition is that in Finland\u0027s Eurajoki where such a site is now under construction. There, nuclear waste will be stored at a maximum depth of 520 meters in shafts bored deep into the granite bedrock. The main obstacle to the construction of nuclear power plants is no longer the anti-nuclear power lobby, but the huge costs of building them. Whereas in 1970 a brand new reactor cost $400 million, a plant now runs as much as 10 times higher. In the last three decades the nuclear power industry has received subsidies of about $1 billion -- the electricity generated may be clean from a global warming point of view, but it\u0027s not cheap. Nonetheless, power plant construction companies are hoping for a renaissance. E.on has applied to build a new plant in Romania\u0027s Cernavoda and Siemens expects orders to triple in the next five years. General Electric too expects a number of new reactors to be built within the next decade, says Ferdinando Beccalli-Falco, a GE manager. Indeed, a lots of companies stand to benefit. The industry is celebrating the \"strategic shift\" and preparing for a boom with mergers en vogue. Japan\u0027s Toshiba has acquired US-based Westinghouse, General Electric is working together with Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy is flirting with the Franco-German global market leader Areva NP, in which Siemens holds a stake. Admiration of France Until now, France has been virtually alone in its reliance on nuclear technology: Eighty percent of its domestically produced power comes from nuclear plants. The 59 plants allow the country to be mostly self-sufficient, and now this strategy is once again being held up as an example. Lithuania, for example, urgently wants to replace its aging Ignalina nuclear reactor. Doing so would allow the country to decrease its dependence on Russia, but the price tag is some 3 billion. Ukraine also wants to build more nuclear power plants in order to increase its self-sufficiency, despite the trauma of Chernobyl. Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are both discussing building two new nuclear reactors each. Poland is considering building a nuclear plant after 2020 since its domestic coal-fired power plants could soon run afoul of EU regulations. Next year the EU wants to tighten the emissions requirements for such polluters. Sites under consideration include Gryfino and Klempicz near Posnan, both of which are close to the German border. Britain\u0027s Labour government wants to prepare the way for new atomic power plants by easing the approval process; many of its aging coal-fired power plants will have to close as a result of new EU standards. Gas-fired plants could help to close the gap, but Europe\u0027s two most important suppliers, Russia\u0027s Gazprom and Algeria\u0027s state-owned Sonatrach, in August signed an agreement that has aroused suspicions in London and Brussels that they will create a cartel similar to OPEC. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso adroitly side-stepped the issue last Wednesday when announcing the EU\u0027s new energy strategy. Germany is joined by a number of other EU countries in their skepticism toward nuclear power. But he did not conceal his committee\u0027s sympathy for atomic power, citing both environmental reasons and issues related to securing Europe\u0027s energy supply. Canada and Australia, the two most significant uranium suppliers, are reliable partners. Other suppliers include Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Namibia and Niger. Kazakhstan wants to surpass Canada as the world\u0027s leading uranium supplier by 2010, which explains why French, Chinese and Japanese companies are racing to invest there. India is considering building 19 new reactors, while China wants to construct at least 63 facilities that will be able to supply 50 giga-watts of power. In emerging market Indonesia a single, very modest, nuclear reactor will go online in 2011. In contrast the US is talking about building more than 20 new plants after a 20-year construction moratorium. Washington is providing tax incentives for power plant operators and it also wants to ease the process of obtaining the required permits. But who is going to pay? President George W. Bush already enthuses about a \"Global Nuclear Energy Partnership\" to foster the use of nuclear power while also monitoring to ensure that the technology is not misused by North Korea, Iran or al-Qaida. The US has budgeted $250 million to support the partnership, and the Hill \u0026 Knowlton public relations company, which worked for the government during the first Gulf war, has already launched a PR campaign to promote nuclear power. The need for advertising seems unavoidable, since even the most enthusiastic supporters of the new atomic era cannot deny that it brings with it the same old risks. No one can rule out a meltdown. And no one can guarantee that civilian nuclear research won\u0027t be misused. Furthermore, no one knows who is going to pay for all the new facilities. Moscow wants to build about 30 new reactors, in part because Gazprom doesn\u0027t want to sell natural gas on the domestic market at low prices. The Kremlin speculates that it will be able to obtain $30 billion from foreign investors to fund their construction, but this money is not likely to appear soon. President Putin has called for the former superpower to take a \"giant leap\" by expanding its nuclear energy sector, but at present it only has one factory capable of manufacturing turbines and reactors. Consequently, Russia can only build one new nuclear power plant every three years. On the other hand, Russia also wants to sell nuclear technology abroad at discount prices, charging roughly 30 percent less than France for its reactors. Despite the lofty ambitions and impressive figures, the fact remains that 1.6 billion people still do not have access to electricity, while 2.4 billion are forced to meet their energy needs with wood, straw or manure. In this respect, Steve Kidd, the director of strategy and research at London\u0027s World Nuclear Association, could be correct. In the nuclear industry, Kidd says, many such grandiose plans often turn out to be delusional.","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9C05E7DB1E30F935A25752C0A9619C8B63","date":"Jan 16, 2007 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":430198320,"title":"Atomic Bomb Survivors Join Nuclear Power Opposition","body":"NAGASAKI, Japan — In 1945, Masahito Hirose saw the white mushroom cloud rise from the atomic bomb that incinerated this city and that left his aunt to die a slow, painful death, bleeding from her nose and gums. Still, like other survivors of the attacks here and in Hiroshima, he quietly accepted Japan’s postwar embrace of nuclear-generated power, believing government assurances that it was both safe and necessary for the nation’s economic rise. That was before this year’s disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in northern Japan confronted the survivors once again with their old nightmare: thousands of civilians exposed to radiation. Aghast at the catastrophic failure of nuclear technology, and outraged by revelations that the government and power industry had planted nuclear proponents at recent town hall-style meetings, the elderly atomic bomb survivors, dwindling in numbers, have begun stepping forward for the first time to oppose nuclear power. Now, as both Hiroshima and Nagasaki observe the 66th anniversary of the American atomic attacks at the end of World War II, the survivors are hoping that they can use their unique moral standing, as the only victims of nuclear bombings, to wean both Japan and the world from what they see as mankind’s tragedy-prone efforts to tap the atom. “Is it Japan’s fate to repeatedly serve as a warning to the world about the dangers of radiation?” said Mr. Hirose, 81, who was a junior high school student when an American bomb obliterated much of Nagasaki, killing about 40,000 people instantly. “I wish we had found the courage to speak out earlier against nuclear power.” But speaking out, even here, was no simple matter. It would have required them to challenge Japan’s postwar establishment, a difficult position in a consensus-driven nation that had put itself on a forced march out of devastation and toward economic development. Their stance also made some historical sense in a country bent on not repeating past mistakes. One of the reasons resource-poor Japan went to war in 1941 was to secure new sources of energy, in that case oil, after an American embargo. Even now, the pressure to adhere to what was the nation’s shared vision for energy security is strong. As Hiroshima observed the anniversary of the bombing, which killed at least 70,000 people there, the city’s mayor on Saturday stopped short of calling for an end to nuclear power, remarking instead that opinions were divided. “Some seek to abandon nuclear power altogether with the belief that mankind cannot coexist with nuclear energy, while others demand stricter regulation of nuclear power and more renewable energy,” said the mayor, Kazumi Matsui. According to Japanese news reports, the mayor, too young to have witnessed the attacks, had considered making a stronger statement in the wake of the Fukushima accident, but pulled back in the face of opposition by business groups. Such reluctance to speak out has made the stronger stance taken by the atomic bombings’ survivors all the more striking. Last month, the Hidankyo, the group representing the 50,000 or so still-living survivors of the bombings, appealed for the first time for Japan to eliminate civilian nuclear power. In its action plan for next year, the group called for halting construction of new nuclear plants and the gradual phasing out of Japan’s 54 current reactors as energy alternatives are found. The group has been a vocal advocate of abolishing nuclear weapons since its founding in 1956. But it has been mute until now on the issue of nuclear power, which Japan continued to pursue even after the accidents decades ago at Chernobyl in Ukraine and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania led many Western nations to shelve nuclear expansion plans. “The bureaucracy, industry and the media were able to shut our eyes to the danger of nuclear power,” said Hirotami Yamada, secretary general of the Nagasaki chapter of Hidankyo. “We let them fool us, even in this country that was the victim of the atomic bomb.” Mr. Hirose, who lost his aunt in the Nagasaki attack, played a leading role in the group’s shift on nuclear power after Fukushima. He was swayed, in part, by his deep understanding of the fears haunting people exposed to radiation from Fukushima. His younger brother died 20 years after the bombing, in his 30s, while suffering from a half-dozen types of cancer. Those still alive, he said, “are living testimony to the horrors of radiation.” Mr. Yamada said many atomic bomb survivors, like other Japanese, accepted nuclear power because they had bought the argument put forward by the government, industry and the news media that Japan’s nuclear reactors were among the best in the world, and absolutely safe. This “safety myth,” as many here now call it, allowed Japanese authorities to dismiss concerns over Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, saying they were caused by poor technology or incompetent plant workers. Some atomic bombing survivors ruefully admit that it took a disaster the size of Fukushima to free them from that myth. “They convinced us that nuclear power was different from nuclear bombs,” said Mr. Yamada, 80, who was a teenager when Nagasaki was bombed. “Fukushima showed us that they are not so different.”","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/world/asia/07hiroshima.html","date":"Aug 6, 2011 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":-1310962098,"title":"Bush Energy Plan Could Revive Nuclear Industry","body":"A proposal in the Bush Administration\u0027s national energy strategy meant to encourage competition in the wholesale electric-generation business could also help revive the nuclear power industry, energy experts say. The proposal, which would remove 55-year-old restrictions on companies owning independent power-generating stations, does not explicitly mention nuclear reactors. And an extensive section in the strategy on promoting nuclear power makes no reference to the proposed change in who may build generating stations. Bypassing State Panels But the provision could help companies that want to build nuclear plants sidestep state public utility commissions. The commissions do not directly regulate independent power plants. \"It allows them to bypass pesky local and state regulators,\" said Gary L. Groesch of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a New Orleans consumer group. \"It\u0027s one of the foundations on which a new nuclear industry would be constructed.\" Mr. Groesch opposes a revival of the nuclear industry and opposes the change. Standley D. Hoch, the chief executive of General Public Utilities, which owns reactors in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said the change would \"certainly help\" a revival of nuclear power. Such a revival would also require a streamlining of licensing procedures, new reactor designs and other changes called for in the energy strategy, he said. So taken alone, he said, removing the ownership restrictions would not cause anyone to build a reactor. The construction of a reactor as an independent power plant, rather than as part of a traditional utility system, is one option under discussion in the nuclear industry, Mr. Hoch said. More Attractive Price General Public Utilities, which buys 25 percent of its supplies on the wholesale market, would be ready to purchase energy from a reactor rather than an independent producer powered by coal or natural gas, he said. \"We would look at the option based on the price of the power, not the technology,\" he said. Many of the companies that might be partners in such new plants are reluctant to endorse the change publicly, because most of those companies\u0027 business is with power utilities, which are deeply divided on the issue. Privately, however, some executives say such a change would make a revival of the nuclear industry more likely. At the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, John B. Yasinsky, executive vice president of the power systems group, said if Congress enacted the change, \"I don\u0027t see that as an overriding factor in bringing nuclear power back.\" But, he added, the change would be helpful. Law Gives S.E.C. Authority At issue is a call to repeal the teeth of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a law that gives the Securities and Exchange Commission jurisdiction over certain kinds of conglomerates that generate power, in the wake of financial scandals. The effect of the law has been to keep industrial companies out of the power business, and to keep utilities out of the business of building generating plants outside their territories and selling the power on the open market. Under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, scores of such plants have been built around the country. Repeal of the critical part of the 1935 law was debated by Congress last year. It is controversial within the utility industry for reasons that are unrelated to nuclear power; some utilities want the restriction lifted so they can build generating stations around the country, while others dislike such independent power plants in their areas and think a change in the act would encourage more of them. But if the act were repealed or substantially modified, experts say, it would allow ownership of reactors by some of the most enthusiastic proponents of a nuclear revival: the companies that once manufactured the components, designed the plants and managed their construction for utilities. Companies Owning Plants Westinghouse and the General Electric Company, for example, which between them manufactured the critical parts for all but a handful of the 110 commercial reactors in the United States, could then take an ownership position in reactors. Both are now spending heavily on preparing new designs for approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Architect-engineering firms that designed the plants and managed their construction could also take a share. Last year, Westinghouse and the Bechtel Group, an San Francisco engineering ceoncern, in a move widely interpreted as preparation for such an investment, agreed to buy a 19-year-old reactor, the Palisades plant in South Haven, Mich., from the Consumers Power Company. Bechtel also took an unusual role at a Pennsylvania reactor, Limerick 2, that would also represent a rehearsal for ownership: It agreed to finish construction with its payment based in part on how smoothly the job went. In previous nuclear construction management contracts, the managers got a fee independent of cost overruns or delays, or they were paid a fee that rose as more money was spent. A nuclear reactor built as an independent power plant would be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has historically been far more generous to utility companies than state regulators, whose ranks include some of the leading opponents of new reactors. If reactors were built by huge, broadly based corporations instead of utilities, financing would be easier. Harvey Wasserman, the senior energy adviser at Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy group, said this would be a big advantage. He opposes the change. Financing Problems Investor-owned utilities would face problems financing new reactors, especially after the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire in 1988 from cost overruns at its Seabrook nuclear plant. But not everyone is convinced that the change would help the nuclear industry. Dan Scotto, a senior vice president of the Donaldson, Lufkin \u0026 Jenrette Securities Corporation, said the change would encourage the construction of other kinds of power plants. These would be tough competition for nuclear reactors, he said, because they are smaller, allowing a better match of supply to demand, and because their risks are lower. Nuclear power, he said, \"is not the technology of first choice for utilities, whether as a hard asset or as a customer for the power.\"","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9D0CE0DE143AF936A35750C0A967958260","date":"Mar 5, 1991 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"},{"id":2036026911,"title":"U.S. Calls Operations At A-Plant Still Flawed","body":"For nearly two and a half years, the Indian Point 3 nuclear power plant here was shut down for a complete overhaul of its management and operating procedures. The problems were so acute that Federal regulators listed it as one of the nation\u0027s three worst-run nuclear plants. Now, three months after the plant resumed generating power, potentially dangerous management problems persist, according to Federal nuclear officials and the nuclear industry\u0027s own internal quality-control group, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. Although no incidents at the restarted reactor have directly threatened public safety, operators several times this summer ran the plant in ways that could increase the risk of an accident, Federal inspectors say. The most significant problem at the plant, on the east bank of the Hudson about 35 miles north of Manhattan, occurred in early July. The reactor was run for two days with its cooling system at a pressure lower than the permitted range, according to inspectors for the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses nuclear plants. Federal inspectors said the problem lay not with the low-pressure operation -- which was most likely not dangerous -- but with the decision to take the plant into essentially uncharted waters by operating it in a way that had not been carefully studied. With Indian Point 3 and a neighboring plant, Indian Point 2, surrounded by more people than any other nuclear site in the country, there is no room for such errors, said Robert D. Pollard, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group that monitors nuclear plant performance. \"Ten percent of the population of the United States lives within 60 miles of Indian Point,\" Mr. Pollard said. When any complex system is run under conditions that have not been thoroughly analyzed, a cascade of unforeseen errors could result in catastrophe, he said. On Monday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that conditions at the plant had improved enough since the summer that it decided not to impose a possible $50,000 fine on the New York Power Authority, Indian Point 3\u0027s owner, for the low-pressure incident. But the agency\u0027s regional administrator, Thomas T. Martin, said in a letter to the Power Authority, the nuclear agency remained \"concerned with the poor performance by your managers and staff prior to, during and in immediate response to the event.\" Indian Point 2 is owned by Consolidated Edison. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency and the Power Authority planned to hold a briefing to update the public on plant conditions on Wednesday. Criticism of the New York Power Authority has also come from within the normally insular nuclear industry itself. William J. Cahill Jr., the chief nuclear officer for the Power Authority, acknowledged in an interview that the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, which acts as something of a nuclear ombudsman, providing confidential assessments of plants, sharply criticized lapses at the plant and training methods. But he emphasized that the industry group had even higher standards than the Federal Government. The most recent shutdown at Indian Point 3 lasted from February 1993 until July 19. The Power Authority replaced 19 of the plant\u0027s 27 top managers and claimed to have instituted among its 900 employees a new \"nuclear religion,\" ordering workers and supervisors to pay more attention to recommended procedure and to be more vigilant about identifying problems. But in an inspection report covering July and early August, Federal engineers noted a continued pattern at the plant of using a strict menu of operating procedures only as loose guidelines, with operators straying occasionally and then not promptly reporting these so-called \"deviation events.\" The most serious incident occurred when workers lowered the pressure in the cooling system that sends water through the hot reactor in an effort to close a jammed valve, the report said. Mr. Cahill said the industry group was particularly critical of this decision. The normal procedure, he said, would be to stop the nuclear reaction in the core of the plant first, then try to close the valve. Conditions seem to be on the upswing at the plant, said Curtis J. Cowgill 3d, the director of nuclear plant inspections for the New York region at N.R.C. In its most recent inspection report, covering Aug. 8 to Sept. 18, the N.R.C. noted only one minor violation, he said. \"When a plant like this starts up, you don\u0027t expect everything to go perfectly,\" Mr. Cowgill said. \"We believe they\u0027re making a good faith effort but still need improvement.\"","url":"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res\u003d9E05E4D61039F93BA25753C1A963958260","date":"Oct 18, 1995 12:00:00 AM","source":"CSV"}]
